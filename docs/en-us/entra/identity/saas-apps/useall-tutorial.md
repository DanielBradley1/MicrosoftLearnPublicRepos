## Configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Useall based on a test user called **Britta Simon**. For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Useall needs to be established.

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Useall Single Sign-On](#configure-useall-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
5. **[Create Useall test user](#create-useall-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Useall that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Useall Single Sign-On

To configure single sign-on on **Useall** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Useall support team](mailto:luizotavio@useall.com.br). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

### Create Useall test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Useall. Work with [Useall support team](mailto:luizotavio@useall.com.br) to add the users in the Useall platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you select the Useall tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Useall for which you set up SSO.
