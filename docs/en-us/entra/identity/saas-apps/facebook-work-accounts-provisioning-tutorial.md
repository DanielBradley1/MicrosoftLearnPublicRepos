# Configure Meta Work Accounts for automatic user provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID

This article describes the steps you need to perform in both Meta Work Accounts and Microsoft Entra ID to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Microsoft Entra ID automatically provisions and de-provisions users and groups to [Meta Work Accounts](https://work.meta.com) using the Microsoft Entra provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning).

## Capabilities supported

- Create users in Meta Work Accounts
- Remove users in Meta Work Accounts when they don't require access anymore
- Keep user attributes synchronized between Microsoft Entra ID and Meta Work Accounts
- Single sign-on to Meta Work Accounts \(recommended\)

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this article assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

- [A Microsoft Entra tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant)
- One of the following roles: [Application Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator), [Cloud Application Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator), or [Application Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#owned-enterprise-applications).
- An admin account in Work Accounts with the permission to change company settings and configure integrations.

## Step 1: Plan your provisioning deployment

1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning).
2. Determine who's in [scope for provisioning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts).
3. Determine what data to [map between Microsoft Entra ID and Meta Work Accounts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes).

## Step 2: Add Meta Work Accounts from the Microsoft Entra application gallery

Add Meta Work Accounts from the Microsoft Entra application gallery to start managing provisioning to Meta Work Accounts. If you have previously setup Meta Work Accounts for SSO, you can use the same application. However, we recommend that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal).

## Step 3: Define who is in scope for provisioning

The Microsoft Entra provisioning service allows you to scope who is provisioned based on assignment to the application, or based on attributes of the user or group. If you choose to scope who is provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the [steps to assign users and groups to the application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal). If you choose to scope who is provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you can [use a scoping filter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts).

- Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before rolling out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can control this by assigning one or two users or groups to the app. When scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify an [attribute based scoping filter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts).
- If you need extra roles, you can [update the application manifest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps) to add new roles.

## Step 4: Configure automatic user provisioning to Meta Work Accounts

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in TestApp based on user and/or group assignments in Microsoft Entra ID.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Meta Work Accounts in Microsoft Entra ID:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator).
2. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps**
3. In the applications list, select **Meta Work Accounts**.
4. Select the **Provisioning** tab.
5. Set **+ New configuration**.

6. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, select **Authorize**. You be redirected to **Meta Work Accounts**'s authorization page. Input your Meta Work Accounts username and select the **Continue** button. Select **Test Connection** to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to Meta Work Accounts. If the connection fails, ensure your Meta Work Accounts account has Admin permissions and try again.

   ![Screenshot shows the Meta Work Accounts authorization page.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/saas-apps/media/facebook-work-accounts-provisioning-tutorial/azure-connect.png)
7. Select **Create** to create your configuration.
8. Select **Properties** in the **Overview** page.
9. Select the pencil to edit the properties. Enable notification emails and provide an email to receive quarantine emails. Enable accidental deletions prevention. Select **Apply** to save the changes.

10. Select **Attribute Mapping** in the left panel and select **users**.
11. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Meta Work Accounts in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Meta Work Accounts for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes), you need to ensure that the Meta Work Accounts API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.
    | Attribute | Type | Supported for filtering |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | userName | String | ✓ |
    | externalId | String |  |
    | active | Boolean |  |
    | title | String |  |
    | emails\[type eq "work"\].value | String |  |
    | preferredLanguage | String |  |
    | name.givenName | String |  |
    | name.familyName | String |  |
    | name.formatted | String |  |
    | addresses\[type eq "work"\].formatted | String |  |
    | addresses\[type eq "work"\].streetAddress | String |  |
    | addresses\[type eq "work"\].locality | String |  |
    | addresses\[type eq "work"\].region | String |  |
    | addresses\[type eq "work"\].postalCode | String |  |
    | addresses\[type eq "work"\].country | String |  |
    | phoneNumbers\[type eq "work"\].value | String |  |
    | urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:employeeNumber | String |  |
    | urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:department | String |  |
12. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts).
13. Use [on-demand provisioning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-provisioning/provision-on-demand) to validate sync with a small number of users before deploying more broadly in your organization.
14. When you're ready to provision, select **Start Provisioning** from the **Overview** page.

## Step 5: Monitor your deployment

Once you configure provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

1. Use the [provisioning logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/concept-provisioning-logs) to determine which users are provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully
2. Check the [progress bar](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it's to completion
3. If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application goes into quarantine. Learn more about quarantine states the [application provisioning quarantine status](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status) article.
