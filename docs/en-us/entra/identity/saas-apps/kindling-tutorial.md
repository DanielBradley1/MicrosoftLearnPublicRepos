## Configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Kindling based on a test user called **Britta Simon**. For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Kindling needs to be established.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Kindling, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Kindling Single Sign-On](#configure-kindling-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
5. **[Create Kindling test user](#create-kindling-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Kindling that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Kindling Single Sign-On

To configure single sign-on on **Kindling** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate \(Base64\)** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [Kindling support team](mailto:support@kindlingapp.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

### Create Kindling test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Kindling. Kindling supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Kindling, a new one is created after authentication.

### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you select the Kindling tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Kindling for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).
