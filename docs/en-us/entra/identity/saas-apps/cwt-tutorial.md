# Configure CWT for Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID

In this article, you learn how to integrate CWT with Microsoft Entra ID. When you integrate CWT with Microsoft Entra ID, you can:

- Control in Microsoft Entra ID who has access to CWT.
- Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to CWT with their Microsoft Entra accounts.
- Manage your accounts in one central location.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

- A Microsoft Entra subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
- CWT single sign-on \(SSO\) enabled subscription.
- Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference).

## Scenario description

In this article, you configure and test Microsoft Entra single sign-on in a test environment.

- CWT supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add CWT from the gallery

To configure the integration of CWT into Microsoft Entra ID, you need to add CWT from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator).
2. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **New application**.
3. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **CWT** in the search box.
4. Select **CWT** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for CWT

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with CWT using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in CWT.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with CWT, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Microsoft Entra SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.

   1. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
   2. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

2. **[Configure CWT SSO](#configure-cwt-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.

   1. **[Create CWT test user](#create-cwt-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in CWT that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Cloud Application Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator).
2. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Enterprise apps** > **CWT** > **Single sign-on**.
3. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
4. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

5. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the application is pre-configured and the necessary URLs are already pre-populated with Azure. The user needs to save the configuration by selecting the **Save** button.
6. On the **Set-up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

   ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/saas-apps/common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

7. On the **Set-up CWT** section, copy the appropriate URL\(s\) as per your requirement.

### Create and assign Microsoft Entra test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users) quickstart to create a test user account called B.Simon.

## Configure CWT SSO

To configure single sign-on on **CWT** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from the application configuration to [CWT support team](https://www.mycwt.com/traveler-help/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create CWT test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in CWT. Work with [CWT support team](https://www.mycwt.com/traveler-help/) to add the users in the CWT platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Microsoft Entra single sign-on configuration with following options.

- Select **Test this application**, and you should be automatically signed in to the CWT for which you set up the SSO.
- You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the CWT tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the CWT for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

Once you configure CWT you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access.
