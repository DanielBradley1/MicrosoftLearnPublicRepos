3. **Create a Microsoft Entra test user** - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **Assign the Microsoft Entra test user** - to enable Britta Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.
5. **[Create IMAGE WORKS test user](#create-image-works-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in IMAGE WORKS that's linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.
