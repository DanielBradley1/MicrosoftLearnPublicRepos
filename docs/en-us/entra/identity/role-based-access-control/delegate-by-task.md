# Least privileged roles by task in Microsoft Entra ID

This article describes the least privileged role you should use for several tasks in Microsoft Entra ID. You will find tasks organized by feature area and the least privileged role required to perform each task, along with additional non-Global Administrator roles that can perform the task.

You can further restrict permissions by assigning roles at smaller scopes or by creating your own custom roles. For more information, see [Assign Microsoft Entra roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/manage-roles-portal) or [Create a custom role in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/custom-create).
