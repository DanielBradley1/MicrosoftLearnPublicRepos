# List Microsoft Entra role assignments

This article describes how to list roles you have assigned in Microsoft Entra ID using the Microsoft Entra admin center, Microsoft Graph PowerShell, or Microsoft Graph API.

Role assignments contain information linking a given security principal \(a user, group, or application service principal\) to a role definition. Listing users, groups, and assigned roles are default user permissions.

## Scopes

In Microsoft Entra ID, roles can be assigned at different scopes.

- Role assignments at tenant scope are added to and can be seen in the list of single application role assignments.
- Role assignments at the single application scope aren't added to and can't be seen in the list of tenant scoped assignments.

## Prerequisites

- [Microsoft Graph PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation) module when using PowerShell
- Admin consent when using Graph explorer for Microsoft Graph API

For more information, see [Prerequisites to use PowerShell or Graph Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/prerequisites).

## List Microsoft Entra role assignments

- [Admin center](#tabpanel_1_admin-center)
- [PowerShell](#tabpanel_1_ms-powershell)
- [Graph API](#tabpanel_1_ms-graph)

### List my role assignments

It's easy to list your own permissions as well. On the **Roles and administrators** page, select **Your Role** to see the roles that are currently assigned to you.

### List role assignments for a user

Follow these steps to list Microsoft Entra roles for a user using the Microsoft Entra admin center. Your experience will be different depending on whether you have [Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management \(PIM\)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure) enabled.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).
2. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Users**.
3. Select *user name* > **Assigned roles**.

   You can see the list of roles assigned to the user at different scopes. Additionally, you can see whether the role has been assigned directly or via a group.

   [![Screenshot of roles assigned to a user.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/media/view-assignments/user-role-assignments.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/media/view-assignments/user-role-assignments.png#lightbox)

   If you have a Microsoft Entra ID P2 license, you'll see the PIM experience, which has eligible, active, and expired role assignment details.

   [![Screenshot of roles assigned to a user in PIM.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/media/view-assignments/user-role-assignments-pim.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/media/view-assignments/user-role-assignments-pim.png#lightbox)

### List role assignments for a group

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com).
2. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Groups** > **All groups**.
3. Select a role-assignable group.

   To determine if a group is role-assignable, you can view the **Properties** for the group.
4. Select **Assigned roles**.

   You can now see all the Microsoft Entra roles assigned to this group. If you don't see the **Assigned roles** option, the group is not a role-assignable group.
