# Group management permissions for Microsoft Entra custom roles

Group management permissions can be used in custom role definitions in Microsoft Entra ID to grant fine-grained access such as the following:

- Manage group properties like name and description
- Manage members and owners
- Create or delete groups
- Read audit logs
- Manage a specific type of group

This article lists the permissions you can use in your custom roles for different group management scenarios. For information about how to create custom roles, see [Create a custom role in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/custom-create).

## License requirements

Using this feature requires Microsoft Entra ID P1 licenses. To find the right license for your requirements, see [Compare generally available features of Microsoft Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access-management/azure-ad-pricing).

| groups.security | Manage security groups of both dynamic and assigned membership type, excluding role-assignable groups |
