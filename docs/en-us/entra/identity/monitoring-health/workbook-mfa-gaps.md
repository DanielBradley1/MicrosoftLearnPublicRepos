# Multifactor Authentication Gaps workbook

The Multifactor Authentication Gaps workbook helps with identifying user sign-ins and applications that aren't protected by multifactor authentication \(MFA\) requirements. This workbook:

- Identifies user sign-ins not protected by MFA requirements.
- Provides further drill down options using various pivots such as applications, operating systems, and location.
- Provides several filters such as trusted locations and device states to narrow down the users/applications.
- Provides filters to scope the workbook for a subset of users and applications.

This article gives you an overview of the **Multifactor authentication gaps** workbook.

## Prerequisites

To use Azure Workbooks for Microsoft Entra ID, you need:

- A Microsoft Entra tenant with a [Premium P1 license](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/get-started-premium)
- A Log Analytics workspace *and* access to that workspace
- The appropriate roles for Azure Monitor *and* Microsoft Entra ID

### Log Analytics workspace

You must create a [Log Analytics workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace) *before* you can use Microsoft Entra Workbooks. several factors determine access to Log Analytics workspaces. You need the right roles for the workspace *and* the resources sending the data.

For more information, see [Manage access to Log Analytics workspaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access).

### Azure Monitor roles

Azure Monitor provides [two built-in roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/roles-permissions-security#monitoring-reader) for viewing monitoring data and editing monitoring settings. Azure role-based access control \(RBAC\) also provides two Log Analytics built-in roles that grant similar access.

- **View**:

  - Monitoring Reader
  - Log Analytics Reader

- **View and modify settings**:

  - Monitoring Contributor
  - Log Analytics Contributor

### Microsoft Entra roles

Read only access allows you to view Microsoft Entra ID log data inside a workbook, query data from Log Analytics, or read logs in the Microsoft Entra admin center. Update access adds the ability to create and edit diagnostic settings to send Microsoft Entra data to a Log Analytics workspace.

- **Read**:

  - Reports Reader
  - Security Reader
  - Global Reader

- **Update**:

  - Security Administrator

For more information on Microsoft Entra built-in roles, see [Microsoft Entra built-in roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference).

For more information on the Log Analytics RBAC roles, see [Azure built-in roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#log-analytics-contributor).
