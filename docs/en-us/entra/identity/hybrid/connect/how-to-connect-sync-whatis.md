# Microsoft Entra Connect Sync: Understand and customize synchronization

Microsoft Entra Connect Sync synchronizes identity data between your on-premises directories and Microsoft Entra ID. It includes an on-premises sync engine and a service component in Microsoft Entra ID. This article explains how Connect Sync works and how to customize it.

This topic is the home for **Microsoft Entra Connect Sync** \(also called **sync engine**\) and lists links to all other topics related to it. For links to Microsoft Entra Connect, see [Integrating your on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/whatis-hybrid-identity).

The sync service consists of two components, the on-premises **Microsoft Entra Connect Sync** component and the service side in Microsoft Entra ID called **Microsoft Entra Connect Sync service**.

Important

Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync is a cloud-managed service for synchronizing users, groups, contacts, and devices from Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID. It uses the Microsoft Entra provisioning agent instead of the Microsoft Entra Connect application. Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync is replacing Microsoft Entra Connect Sync, which will be retired after Cloud Sync has full functional parity with Connect Sync. The remainder of this article describes Microsoft Entra Connect Sync. Review Cloud Sync capabilities before deploying Connect Sync.

For device synchronization, see [Configure device sync with Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/cloud-sync/device-sync).

To find out if you are already eligible for cloud sync, please verify your requirements in [this wizard](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home?Q=setupguidance#/modernonboarding/identitywizard).
