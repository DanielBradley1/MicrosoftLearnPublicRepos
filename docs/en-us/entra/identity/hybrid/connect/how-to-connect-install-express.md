# Get started with Microsoft Entra Connect Sync by using express settings

If you have a single-forest topology and use [password hash sync](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronization) for authentication, express settings are a good option to use when you install Microsoft Entra Connect Sync. Express settings the default option to install Microsoft Entra Connect Sync, and it's used for the most commonly deployed scenario. It's only a few short steps to extend your on-premises directory to the cloud.

Before you start installing Microsoft Entra Connect Sync, [download Microsoft Entra Connect Sync](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_Connect_Provisioning/AADConnectMenuBlade/%7E/GetStarted), and be sure to complete the prerequisite steps in [Microsoft Entra Connect: Hardware and prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-install-prerequisites).

If the express settings installation doesn't match your topology, see [Related articles](#related-articles) for information about other scenarios.

7. The [Microsoft Entra ID sign-in configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/plan-connect-user-signin#azure-ad-sign-in-configuration) page appears only if you didn't complete the step to [verify your domains](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/add-custom-domain) in the [prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-install-prerequisites).

[![Screenshot that shows examples of unverified domains in the installation wizard.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/media/how-to-connect-install-express/install-7.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/media/how-to-connect-install-express/install-7.png#lightbox)

If you see this page, review each domain that's marked **Not Added** or **Not Verified**. Make sure that those domains have been verified in Microsoft Entra ID. When you've verified your domains, select the **Refresh** icon.

8. In **Ready to configure**, select **Install**.

- Optionally in **Ready to configure**, you can clear the **Start the synchronization process as soon as configuration completes** checkbox. You should clear this checkbox if you want to do more configurations, such as to add [filtering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-sync-configure-filtering). If you clear this option, the wizard configures sync but leaves the scheduler disabled. The scheduler doesn't run until you enable it manually by [rerunning the installation wizard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-installation-wizard).
- If you leave the **Start the synchronization process when configuration completes** checkbox selected, a full sync of all users, groups, and contacts to Microsoft Entra ID begins immediately.
- If you have Exchange in your instance of Windows Server Active Directory, you also have the option to enable [Exchange Hybrid deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/exchange-hybrid). Enable this option if you plan to have Exchange mailboxes both in the cloud and on-premises at the same time.
