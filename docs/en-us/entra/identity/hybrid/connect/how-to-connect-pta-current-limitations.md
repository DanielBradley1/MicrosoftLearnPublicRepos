# Microsoft Entra pass-through authentication: Current limitations

## Supported scenarios

The following scenarios are supported:

- User sign-ins to web browser-based applications.
- User sign-ins to legacy Office client applications and Office applications that support [modern authentication](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2015/11/19/updated-office-365-modern-authentication-public-preview): Office 2013 and 2016 versions.
- User sign-ins to legacy protocol applications such as PowerShell version 1.0 and others.
- Microsoft Entra joins for Windows 10 and later devices.
- Hybrid Microsoft Entra joins for Windows 10 and later devices.

## Unsupported scenarios

The following scenarios *aren't* supported:

- Detection of users with [leaked credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/overview-identity-protection).
- Microsoft Entra Domain Services needs Password Hash Synchronization to be enabled on the tenant. Therefore tenants that use Pass-through Authentication *only* don't work for scenarios that need Microsoft Entra Domain Services.
- Pass-through Authentication isn't integrated with [Microsoft Entra Connect Health](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/whatis-azure-ad-connect).
- Signing in to Microsoft Entra joined \(AADJ\) devices with a temporary or expired password isn't supported for Pass-through authentication users. The error "the sign-in method you're trying to use isn't allowed" will appear. These users must sign in to a browser to update their temporary password.

Important

As a workaround for unsupported scenarios *only* \(except Microsoft Entra Connect Health integration\), enable Password Hash Synchronization on the [Optional features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-install-custom#optional-features) page in the Microsoft Entra Connect wizard.

Note

Enabling Password Hash Synchronization gives you the option to failover authentication if your on-premises infrastructure is disrupted. This failover from Pass-through Authentication to Password Hash Synchronization isn't automatic. You'll need to switch the sign-in method manually using Microsoft Entra Connect. If the server running Microsoft Entra Connect goes down, you'll require help from Microsoft Support to turn off Pass-through Authentication.
