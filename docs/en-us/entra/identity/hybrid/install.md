# Install your synchronization tool

The following document provides the steps to install either cloud sync or Microsoft Entra Connect.

## Install the Microsoft Entra provisioning agent for cloud sync

Cloud sync uses the Microsoft Entra provisioning agent. Use the steps below to install it.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Hybrid Identity Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#hybrid-identity-administrator).
2. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Entra Connect** > **Cloud sync**.

3. Select **cloud sync**
4. On the left, select **Agent**.
5. Select **Download on-premises agent**, and select **Accept terms & download**.
6. Once the **Microsoft Entra provisioning agent package** has completed downloading, run the *AADConnectProvisioningAgentSetup.exe* installation file from your downloads folder.
7. On the splash screen, select **I agree to the license and conditions**, and then select **Install**.
8. Once the installation operation completes, the configuration wizard launches. Select **Next** to start the configuration.

12. On the **Connect Active Directory** screen, if your domain name appears under **Configured domains**, skip to the next step. Otherwise, type your Active Directory domain name, and select **Add directory**.
13. Sign in with your Active Directory domain administrator account. Select **OK**, then select **Next** to continue.

## Install Microsoft Entra Connect with express settings

Express settings are the default option to install Microsoft Entra Connect, and it's used for the most commonly deployed scenario.

1. Sign in as Local Administrator on the server you want to install Microsoft Entra Connect on. The server you sign in on is the sync server.
2. Go to *AzureADConnect.msi* and double-select to open the installation file.
3. On **Welcome**, select the checkbox to agree to the licensing terms, and then select **Continue**.
4. On **Express settings**, select **Use express settings**.
5. On **Connect to Microsoft Entra ID**, enter the username and password of the Hybrid Identity Administrator account, and then select **Next**.
6. On **Connect to AD DS**, enter the username and password for an Enterprise Admin account. You can enter the domain part in either NetBIOS or FQDN format, like `FABRIKAM\administrator` or `fabrikam.com\administrator`. Select **Next**
7. The [Microsoft Entra sign-in configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/plan-connect-user-signin#azure-ad-sign-in-configuration) page appears only if you didn't complete the step to [verify your domains](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/add-custom-domain) in the [prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-install-prerequisites)
8. On **Ready to configure**, select **Install**
9. When the installation is finished, select **Exit**.
10. Before you use Synchronization Service Manager or Synchronization Rule Editor, sign out, and then sign in again.
