For more information about the availability of Microsoft Entra ID passkey \(FIDO2\) authentication across native applications, web browsers, and operating systems, see [Support for FIDO2 authentication with Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-fido2-compatibility).

To sign in with a passkey in Authenticator, your iOS device needs to run iOS 17 or later.

### Same-device authentication in a browser \(iOS\)

Follow these steps to sign in to Microsoft Entra ID with a passkey in Authenticator on your iOS device.

1. On your iOS device, open your browser and go to the resource you're trying to access, such as [Office](https://www.office.com).
2. Enter your username to sign in. If you most recently used a passkey to sign in, you're prompted to sign in with a passkey. Otherwise, select **Other ways to sign in**, and then select **Face, fingerprint, PIN or security key**.

   Alternatively, select **Sign-in options** to sign in without entering a username. If you selected **Sign-in options**, then select **Face, fingerprint, PIN or security key**. Otherwise, skip to the next step.

   Note

   If you try to sign in without a username and multiple passkeys are saved to your device, you're prompted to choose which passkey to use for sign-in.
3. To select your passkey, follow the steps in the iOS operating system dialog. Verify yourself by using Face ID or Touch ID, or by entering your device PIN.

You're now signed in to Microsoft Entra ID.

### Cross-device authentication \(iOS\)

Follow these steps to sign in to Microsoft Entra ID on another device with a passkey in Authenticator on your iOS device.

This sign-in option requires Bluetooth and an internet connection for both devices. If your organization restricts Bluetooth usage, an administrator can allow cross-device sign-in for passkeys by permitting Bluetooth pairing exclusively with passkey-enabled FIDO2 authenticators. For more information about how to configure Bluetooth usage only for passkeys, see [Passkeys in Bluetooth-restricted environments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/passkeys/?tabs=windows%2Cintune#passkeys-in-bluetooth-restricted-environments).

1. On the other device where you want to sign in to Microsoft Entra ID, go to the resource you're trying to access, such as [Office](https://www.office.com).
2. Enter your username to sign in. If you last used a passkey to authenticate, you're prompted to authenticate with a passkey. Otherwise, select **Other ways to sign in**, and then select **Face, fingerprint, PIN or security key**.

   Alternatively, select **Sign-in options** to sign in without entering a username. If you selected **Sign-in options**, then select **Face, fingerprint, PIN or security key**. Otherwise, skip to the next step.

   Note

   If you try to sign in without a username and multiple passkeys are saved to your device, you're prompted to choose which passkey to use for sign-in.
3. To begin cross-device authentication, follow the steps in the operating system or browser prompt. On Windows 11 23H2 or later, select **iPhone, iPad, or Android device**.
4. When a QR code appears on the screen, open the camera app and scan the QR code.

   The camera inside the iOS Authenticator app doesn't support scanning a WebAuthn QR code. You need to use the system camera app.
5. Select **Sign in with passkey** when the option appears.

   Bluetooth and an internet connection are required for this step and must both be enabled on your mobile and remote device.
6. To select your passkey, follow the steps in the iOS operating system dialog. Verify yourself by using Face ID or Touch ID, or by entering your device PIN.

You're now signed in to Microsoft Entra ID on your other device.

### Same-device authentication in native Microsoft applications \(iOS\)

You can use Authenticator on your iOS device to seamlessly sign in with a passkey to other Microsoft apps, such as OneDrive, SharePoint, and Outlook.

To sign in with a passkey in Authenticator, your Android device needs to run Android 14 or later.

Note

Support for same-device authentication in Microsoft Edge on Android is coming soon.

2. Enter your username to sign in. If you most recently used a passkey to sign in, you're prompted to sign in with a passkey. Otherwise, select **Other ways to sign in**, and then select **Face, fingerprint, PIN or security key**.

   Alternatively, select **Sign-in options** to sign in without entering a username. If you selected **Sign-in options**, then select **Face, fingerprint, PIN or security key**. Otherwise, skip to the next step.

You're now signed in to Microsoft Entra ID.
