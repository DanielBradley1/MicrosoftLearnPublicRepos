# App support for SMS-based authentication

SMS-based authentication is available to Microsoft apps integrated with the Microsoft identity platform \(Microsoft Entra ID\). This article lists the web and mobile apps that support SMS-based authentication.

## Move to modern, phishing-resistant authentication

Important

Microsoft recommends phishing-resistant authentication methods for improved security. Consider migrating users to one of the following methods:

- [Passkeys \(FIDO2\)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-passkeys-fido2)
- [Windows Hello for Business](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-overview)
- [Certificate-based authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication)

SMS-based authentication is available to Microsoft apps integrated with the Microsoft identity platform \(Microsoft Entra ID\). The table lists some of the web and mobile apps that support SMS-based authentication.

| App | Web/browser app | Native mobile app |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Office 365- Microsoft Online Services\* | ● |  |
| Microsoft One Note | ● |  |
| Microsoft Teams | ● | ● |
| Company portal | ● | ● |
| My Apps portal | ● | Not available |
| Microsoft Forms | ● | Not available |

\**SMS sign-in isn't available for office applications, such as Word, Excel, etc., when accessed directly on the web, but is available when accessed through the [Office 365 web app](https://www.office.com)*

The above mentioned Microsoft apps support SMS sign-in is because they use the Microsoft Identity login \(`https://login.microsoftonline.com/`\), which allows users to enter phone number and SMS code.

## Unsupported Microsoft apps

Microsoft 365 desktop \(Windows or Mac\) apps and Microsoft 365 web apps \(except MS One Note\) that are accessed directly on the web don't support SMS sign-in. These apps use the Microsoft Office login \(`https://office.live.com/start/*`\) that requires a password to sign in. For the same reason, Microsoft Office mobile apps \(except Microsoft Teams, Company portal, and Microsoft Azure\) don't support SMS sign-in.

| Unsupported Microsoft apps | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Native desktop Microsoft apps | Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 apps, Word, Excel, and so on. |
| Native mobile Microsoft apps \(except Microsoft Teams, Company portal, and Microsoft Azure\) | Outlook, Edge, Power BI, Stream, SharePoint, Power Apps, Word, and so on. |
| Microsoft 365 web apps \(accessed directly on web\) | [Outlook](https://outlook.live.com/owa/), [Word](https://office.live.com/start/Word.aspx), [Excel](https://office.live.com/start/Excel.aspx), [PowerPoint](https://office.live.com/start/PowerPoint.aspx) |

## Support for Non-Microsoft apps

To make Non-Microsoft apps compatible with the SMS sign-in feature:

- Integrate Non-Microsoft web apps with Microsoft Entra ID and use Microsoft Entra authentication. Use Security Assertion Markup Language [SAML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-setup-sso) or OpenID Connect [OIDC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-setup-oidc-sso) to integrate with Microsoft Entra SSO.
- Integrate Non-Microsoft on-premises apps with Microsoft Entra ID using [Microsoft Entra application proxy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application)
- Integrate Non-Microsoft client apps with [Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-overview) for authentication

  - [Sample app iOS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/tutorial-v2-ios)
  - [Sample app Android](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/tutorial-v2-android)
