If your organization has federated your on-premises Active Directory with Microsoft Entra ID using AD FS, there are two options for using Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication.

- Secure cloud resources using Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication or Active Directory Federation Services
- Secure cloud and on-premises resources using Azure Multifactor Authentication Server

The following table summarizes the verification experience between securing resources with Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication and AD FS

| Verification Experience - Browser-based Apps | Verification Experience - Non-Browser-based Apps |
| :--- | :--- |
| Securing Microsoft Entra resources using Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication | <li>The first verification step is performed on-premises using AD FS.</li><br><br><li>The second step is a phone-based method carried out using cloud authentication.</li> |
| Securing Microsoft Entra resources using Active Directory Federation Services | <li>The first verification step is performed on-premises using AD FS.</li><br><br><li>The second step is performed on-premises by honoring the claim.</li> |

Caveats with app passwords for federated users:

- App passwords are verified using cloud authentication, so they bypass federation. Federation is only actively used when setting up an app password.
- On-premises Client Access Control settings aren't honored by app passwords.
- You lose on-premises authentication-logging capability for app passwords.
- Account disable/deletion may take up to three hours for directory sync, delaying disable/deletion of app passwords in the cloud identity.
