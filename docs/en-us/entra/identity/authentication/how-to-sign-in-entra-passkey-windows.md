# Sign in with a Microsoft Entra passkey on Windows

This article covers how to sign in to Microsoft Entra ID with a Microsoft Entra passkey on Windows. A Microsoft Entra passkey on Windows is a device-bound passkey stored in the local Windows Hello container.

## Sign in with a passkey on Windows

To sign in with a passkey on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser and go to the resource you're trying to access, such as [Office](https://www.office.com).
2. You can enter your username to sign in. If you most recently used a passkey to sign in, you're automatically prompted to sign in with a passkey. Otherwise, select **Other ways to sign in**, and then select **Face, fingerprint, PIN, or security key**.

   Alternatively, select **Sign-in options** to sign in without entering a username. If you chose **Sign-in options**, select **Face, fingerprint, PIN, or security key**. Otherwise, skip to the next step.
3. Your device opens a Windows Security dialog. Verify your identity by using Windows Hello \(fingerprint, facial recognition, or PIN\).

After verification, you're signed in to Microsoft Entra ID.
