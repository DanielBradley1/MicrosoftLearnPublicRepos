# Understand how users are assigned to apps

This article helps you to understand how users get assigned to an application in your tenant.

## How do users get assigned an application in Microsoft Entra ID?

There are several ways a user can be assigned an application. Assignment can be performed by an administrator, a business delegate, or sometimes, the user themselves. Below describes the ways users can get assigned to applications:

- An administrator [assigns a user](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal) to the application directly
- An administrator [assigns a group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal) that the user is a member of to the application, including:

  - A group that was synchronized from on-premises
  - A static security group created in the cloud
  - A [dynamic security group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/users/groups-dynamic-membership) created in the cloud
  - A Microsoft 365 group created in the cloud
  - The [All Users](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups) group

- An administrator enables [Self-service Application Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/manage-self-service-access) to allow a user to add an application using [My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510) **Add App** feature **without business approval**
