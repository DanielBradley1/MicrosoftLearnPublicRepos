# Delete an enterprise application

In this article, you learn how to delete an enterprise application that was added to your Microsoft Entra tenant.

When you delete and enterprise application, it remains in a suspended state in the recycle bin for 30 days. During the 30 days, you can [Restore the application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/restore-application). Deleted items are automatically hard deleted after the 30-day period. For more information on frequently asked questions about deletion and recovery of applications, see [Deleting and recovering applications FAQs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/delete-recover-faq).

Important

Before deleting an enterprise application, consider whether [deactivating it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/deactivate-application-portal) meets your needs. Deactivation prevents token issuance and user sign-in while preserving the application configuration, making it ideal for investigation, security incidents, or temporary suspension.
