# Quickstart: Naming policy for groups in Microsoft Entra ID

## Overview

In this quickstart, in Microsoft Entra ID, part of Microsoft Entra, you set up naming policy in your Microsoft Entra organization for user-created Microsoft 365 groups, to help you sort and search your groups. For example, you could use the naming policy to:

- Communicate the function of a group, membership, geographic region, or who created the group.
- Help categorize groups in the address book.
- Block specific words from being used in group names and aliases.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before you begin.

## Configure the group naming policy

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Groups Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#groups-administrator).
2. Select **Microsoft Entra ID**.
3. Select **Groups** > **All groups**, then select **Naming policy** to open the **Naming policy** page.
