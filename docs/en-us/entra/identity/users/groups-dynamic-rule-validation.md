# Validate rules for dynamic membership groups in Microsoft Entra ID

## Overview

Microsoft Entra ID provides the means to validate rules for dynamic membership groups. On the **Validate rules** tab, you can validate a rule against sample group members to confirm that the rule is working as expected.

When you create or update rules for dynamic membership groups, you want to know whether a user or a device is a member of the group. This knowledge helps you evaluate whether a user or device meets the rule criteria. It also helps you troubleshoot when membership isn't expected.

## Prerequisites

To evaluate the rule for dynamic membership groups, the administrator must be at least a [Groups Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#groups-administrator).

Warning

Assigning one of the required roles via indirect role assignment isn't supported.

## Validate a rule for dynamic membership groups

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a Groups Administrator.
2. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Groups** > **All groups**.
3. Select an existing dynamic group or create a new dynamic group, and then select **Dynamic membership rules**.
