# Require MFA for administrators

## Overview

Warning

This article describes a Conditional Access policy that uses the **Require multifactor authentication** grant control. For stronger protection against phishing attacks, consider using **authentication strength** to require phishing-resistant MFA methods instead. For more information, see [Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication for administrators](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-admin-phish-resistant-mfa).

Accounts that are assigned administrative rights are targeted by attackers. Requiring multifactor authentication \(MFA\) on those accounts is an easy way to reduce the risk of those accounts being compromised.

Microsoft recommends you require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication on the following roles at a minimum:

- Global Administrator
- Application Administrator
- Authentication Administrator
- Billing Administrator
- Cloud Application Administrator
- Conditional Access Administrator
- Exchange Administrator
- Helpdesk Administrator
- Password Administrator
- Privileged Authentication Administrator
- Privileged Role Administrator
- Security Administrator
- SharePoint Administrator
- User Administrator

Organizations can choose to include or exclude roles as they see fit.

## User exclusions

Conditional Access policies are powerful tools. We recommend excluding the following accounts from your policies:

- **Emergency access** or **break-glass** accounts to prevent lockout due to policy misconfiguration. In the unlikely scenario where all administrators are locked out, your emergency access administrative account can be used to sign in and recover access.

  - More information can be found in the article, [Manage emergency access accounts in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/security-emergency-access).

- **Service accounts** and **Service principals**, such as the Microsoft Entra Connect Sync Account. Service accounts are noninteractive accounts that aren't tied to any specific user. They're typically used by backend services to allow programmatic access to applications, but they're also used to sign in to systems for administrative purposes. Calls made by service principals aren't blocked by Conditional Access policies scoped to users. Use Conditional Access for workload identities to define policies that target service principals.

  - If your organization uses these accounts in scripts or code, replace them with [managed identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).

## Template deployment

Organizations can deploy this policy by following the steps outlined below or by using the [Conditional Access templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policy-common).

## Create a Conditional Access policy

The following steps help create a Conditional Access policy to require those assigned administrative roles to perform multifactor authentication. Some organizations might be ready to move to stronger authentication methods for their administrators. These organizations might choose to implement a policy like the one described in the article [Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication for administrators](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-admin-phish-resistant-mfa).

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least a [Conditional Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#conditional-access-administrator).
2. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Conditional Access** > **Policies**.
3. Select **New policy**.
4. Give your policy a name. Create a meaningful standard for the names of your policies.
5. Under **Assignments**, select **Users or workload identities**.

   1. Under **Include**, select **Directory roles** and choose at least the previously listed roles.

      Warning

      Conditional Access policies support built-in roles. Conditional Access policies are not enforced for other role types including [administrative unit-scoped](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/manage-roles-portal) or [custom roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/custom-create).
   2. Under **Exclude**, select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts.

6. Under **Target resources** > **Resources \(formerly cloud apps\)** > **Include**, select **All resources \(formerly 'All cloud apps'\)**.
7. Under **Access controls** > **Grant**, select **Grant access**, **Require multifactor authentication**, and select **Select**.
8. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **Report-only**.
9. Select **Create** to enable your policy.

After confirming your settings using [policy impact or report-only mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-report-only#reviewing-results), move the **Enable policy** toggle from **Report-only** to **On**.
