# Update user attributes with Lifecycle Workflows

Lifecycle Workflows allow you to automate the updating of user attributes as part of joiner, mover, and leaver scenarios. The **Update user attributes** task enables you to set or clear attribute values for users in your organization when lifecycle events occur, such as a department change or an employee leaving.

This article walks you through configuring a workflow with the Update user attributes task using the Microsoft Entra admin center and Microsoft Graph.

## Prerequisites

Using this feature requires Microsoft Entra ID Governance or Microsoft Entra Suite licenses. To find the right license for your requirements, see [Microsoft Entra ID Governance licensing fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/licensing-fundamentals).

## Supported attributes

The Update user attributes task supports the following attribute types:

- Built-in user attributes for cloud-managed users \(for example, `department`, `jobTitle`, `employeeLeaveDateTime`\)
- On-premises extension attributes for cloud-managed users \(for example, `extensionAttribute1` through `extensionAttribute15`\)
- Directory extension attributes for cloud-managed users and users synced from on-premises AD

Note

Custom security attributes are not supported with this task.

Note

For datetime attributes, you can specify either a specific date or use `system.now`. When set to `system.now`, the attribute will be set to the date when the task is processed.

## Limitations

Before configuring this task, be aware of the following limitations:

- **Up to 10 attributes** can be updated per task instance.
- For **users synced from on-premises AD**, this task supports **directory extension attributes only**.
