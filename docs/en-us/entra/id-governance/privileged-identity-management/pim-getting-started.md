# Start using Privileged Identity Management

## Overview

Use Privileged Identity Management \(PIM\) to manage, control, and monitor access within your Microsoft Entra organization. With PIM you can provide as-needed and just-in-time access to Azure resources, Microsoft Entra resources, and other Microsoft online services like Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Intune.

This article describes how to enable Privileged Identity Management \(PIM\) and get started using it.

## Prerequisites

To use Privileged Identity Management, you must have a Microsoft Entra ID P2 or Microsoft Entra ID Governance license. For more information on licensing, see [Microsoft Entra ID Governance licensing fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/licensing-fundamentals).

## Activation of role assignments

When a Microsoft Entra tenant has a Microsoft Entra ID P2 or Microsoft Entra ID Governance license, users with active role assignments can do the following:

- Open the **Roles and administrators** page in Microsoft Entra ID and select a role.
- Open the **Privileged Identity Management** page.
- Make calls to PIM using the [Microsoft Entra roles API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/identity-network-access-overview/).

Microsoft Entra enables PIM for the tenant in the following ways:

- Starting immediately, you can create eligible or time-bound assignments for Microsoft Entra roles;
- Global Administrators or Privileged Role Administrators may start receiving other emails, such as the PIM weekly digest;
- The PIM service principal name \(MS–PIM\) may get mentioned in audit log events related to role assignment management.

These behaviors are expected and shouldn't affect your workflows.
