# Microsoft Entra ID Entitlement Management integration with ServiceNow

## Overview

Microsoft Entra ID Entitlement Management integrates with ServiceNow, providing an alternative portal where users can request access packages, view request history, and approve or deny requests when they're designated as approvers.

Microsoft Entra ID Entitlement Management remains the system of record. Administrators create and manage catalogs, access packages, assignment policies, requestor eligibility, approvers, and assignments in Microsoft Entra ID Entitlement Management. ServiceNow provides the end-user request and approval experience.
