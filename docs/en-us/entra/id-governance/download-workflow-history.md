# Download workflow history reports

The Lifecycle Workflows history feature allows you to view details about the actions of a workflow such as when it runs, processes a task, or processes a user. From the Microsoft Entra admin center, you're able to filter this information up to 30 days from when the action was taken. To store this information for a longer period of time, you can save the history as a CSV report. This article walks you through how you can download these reports.
