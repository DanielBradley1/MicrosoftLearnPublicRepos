# Delete a lifecycle workflow

You can remove workflows that you no longer need. Deleting these workflows helps keep your lifecycle strategy up to date.

When a workflow is deleted, it enters a soft-delete state. During this period, you can still view it in the list of deleted workflows and restore it if needed. A workflow is permanently removed 30 days after it enters a soft-delete state. If you don't want to wait 30 days for a workflow to be permanently deleted, you can manually delete it.

## Prerequisites

Using this feature requires Microsoft Entra ID Governance or Microsoft Entra Suite licenses. To find the right license for your requirements, see [Microsoft Entra ID Governance licensing fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/licensing-fundamentals).

## Delete a workflow by using the Microsoft Entra admin center

2. Browse to **ID Governance** > **Lifecycle workflows** > **Workflows**.

## View deleted workflows in the Microsoft Entra admin center

After you delete workflows, you can view them on the **Deleted workflows** page.

1. On the left pane, select **Deleted workflows**.
2. On the **Deleted workflows** page, check the list of deleted workflows. Each workflow has a description, the date of deletion, and a permanent delete date. By default, the permanent delete date for a workflow is 30 days after it was originally deleted.
