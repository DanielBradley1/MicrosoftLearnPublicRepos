# Hide or delete an access package in entitlement management

When you create access packages, they're discoverable by default. This means that if a policy allows a user to request the access package, they'll automatically see the access package listed in their My Access portal. However, you can change the **Hidden** setting so that the access package isn't listed in the user's My Access portal. A user will only see the access packages from a given tenant in their My Access portal. Users can either use the organization/tenant switcher which is located on the top right of the My Access portal or a My Access portal link which includes a tenant hint. For more information, see [Share link to request an access package](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-access-package-settings).

This article describes how to hide or delete an access package.

## Change the Hidden setting

Follow these steps to change the **Hidden** setting for an access package.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as at least an [Identity Governance Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#identity-governance-administrator).

   Tip

   Other least privilege roles that can complete this task include the Catalog owner and Access Package manager.
2. Browse to **ID Governance** > **Entitlement management** > **Access package**.
3. On the Access packages page, open an access package.
4. On the Overview page, select **Edit**.
5. Set the **Hidden** setting.

   If set to **No**, the access package is listed in the user's My Access portal.

   If set to **Yes**, the access package won't be listed in the user's My Access portal. The only way a user can view the access package is if they have the direct **My Access portal link** to the access package. For more information, see [Share link to request an access package](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-access-package-settings).
