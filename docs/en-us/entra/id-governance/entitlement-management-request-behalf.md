# Request access package on-behalf-of other identities

Entitlement Management enables admins to create access packages to manage their organization’s resources. Admins can either directly assign identities to an access package, or configure an access package policy that allows users and group members to request access. The option to create self-service processes is useful, especially as organizations scale and hire more employees. However, new employees joining an organization might not always know what they need access to, or how they can request access. In this case, a new employee would likely rely on their manager to guide them through the access request process. Instead of having new employees navigate the request process, managers can request access packages for their employees, making onboarding faster and more seamless. To enable this functionality for managers, admins can select an option when setting up an access package policy that allows managers to request access on their employees' behalf.

Expanding self-service request flows to allow requests on behalf of identities ensures that identities have timely access to necessary resources, and increases productivity.

## Scenarios for managers requesting on behalf of employees

Imagine your organization hires hundreds of new employees each year, and you're being tasked with training new hires on IT processes, including how to request access for resources in My Access. Training sessions are only at the beginning of each month, so managers of new hires who start later in the month often reach out for ad-hoc training. This is becoming increasingly common.

Instead of conducting numerous ad-hoc training sessions to ensure new hires know how to request access in their first week or weeks at the organization, you can set up access package policies that allow managers to request access on behalf of their employees.

Now, managers are empowered to request access on behalf of new hires who haven't gone through the IT training. This ensures that employees have the tools and resources necessary to start on day one, and increases new hire satisfaction as they don’t need to wait for access or navigate the request process on their own.

## Scenarios for users requesting on behalf of other users

Imagine you're leading a project that includes employees, contractors, or external collaborators. You already know which resources each person needs, but some participants might be unfamiliar with My Access or your organization's access request process. Asking everyone to submit their own request can lead to confusion and delays, especially when a project needs to get started quickly. Instead, your organization can set up access package policies that allow designated users, such as project leads, team coordinators, or help desk personnel, to request access on behalf of others. This allows you to select the person who needs access, choose the appropriate access package, and provide the required request details for them. The request still follows the approval and access lifecycle processes defined in the policy, helping your organization maintain oversight while making the experience easier for users

## Scenarios for requesting on behalf of agent identities

The ability for administrators to request on behalf of agent identities they own or sponsor is also another key scenario for requesting access packages on behalf of other identities. With the ability to request an access package for an agent identity, You're able to ensure that agents working on behalf of you in your environment has the access to what they need to do their job, but nothing further.
