# Manage remote networks

## Overview

Remote networks connect your users in remote locations to Global Secure Access. Adding, updating, and removing remote networks from your environment are likely common tasks for many organizations.

This article explains how to manage your existing remote networks for Global Secure Access.

## Prerequisites

- A **Global Secure Access Administrator** role in Microsoft Entra ID.
- The product requires licensing. For details, see the licensing section of [What is Global Secure Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/overview-what-is-global-secure-access). If needed, you can [purchase licenses or get trial licenses](https://aka.ms/azureadlicense).

### Known limitations

For detailed information about known issues and limitations, see [Known limitations for Global Secure Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/reference-current-known-limitations).

## Update remote networks

You can update remote networks in the Microsoft Entra admin center or using the Microsoft Graph API.

- [Microsoft Entra admin center](#tabpanel_1_microsoft-entra-admin-center)
- [Microsoft Graph API](#tabpanel_1_microsoft-graph-api)

To update the details of your remote networks:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as a [Global Secure Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-secure-access-administrator).
2. Browse to **Global Secure Access** > **Connect** > **Remote networks**.
3. Select the remote network you need to update.

There are three sections with details you can edit. **Basics**, **Links**, and **Traffic profiles**.

#### Update basic settings

The basics page provides a way to delete a selected remote network. You change the name of a remote network after you create it. Select the pencil icon to edit the name of the remote network.

#### Update traffic profiles

From this page, you can enable or disable the available traffic forwarding profiles. The Microsoft traffic and Internet Access profiles can be assigned to remote networks. The Private Access profile requires the Global Secure Access client. For more information, see [Assign a traffic profile to a remote network](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-assign-traffic-profile-to-remote-network).

You can also assign a remote network to the Microsoft traffic forwarding profile from **Traffic forwarding** area of Global Secure Access. Browse to **Connect** > **Traffic forwarding** and select **Add/edit assignments** for the traffic profile. For more information, see [Global Secure Access traffic forwarding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/concept-traffic-forwarding).
