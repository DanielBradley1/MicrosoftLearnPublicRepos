# Tutorial: Get started with Microsoft Entra Internet Access labs

This learning lab series provides hands-on experience with Microsoft Entra Internet Access, a cloud-delivered secure web gateway and AI gateway.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

- Recognize what Internet Access is and understand how it works.
- Review security service edge \(SSE\) concepts and capabilities.
- Navigate the learning progression for the lab series.

## What is Microsoft Entra Internet Access?

Internet Access is part of the Microsoft SSE solution. It works by routing internet traffic through the Microsoft globally distributed cloud proxies, where security policies are applied before traffic reaches its destination.

As a secure web gateway, it protects users and devices from internet threats while enabling secure, identity-aware access to web resources. As an AI Gateway, it gives admins visibility into shadow AI apps, protects your organization's data behind your company AI tools, and helps prevent data leakage to unauthorized AI sites.

This approach provides:

- **Identity-aware security**: Policies can be targeted based on user identity, group membership, and device state.
- **Cloud-native protection**: No on-premises infrastructure to maintain.
- **Zero Trust alignment**: Every request is evaluated against your security policies.

## How to run the lab exercises

This series of exercises covers the fundamentals of Internet Access. The exercises assume that you follow them in order. If you skip around, you might miss a step. For example, in the baseline web-filtering tutorial, you create a security profile and assign it to a Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policy. Subsequent labs instruct you to assign the new policy to this existing security profile rather than creating a new security profile and Conditional Access policy each time.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial series, you need the following:

- Microsoft Entra ID tenant with P1 and either Microsoft Entra Internet Access or Microsoft Entra Suite licenses.
- Either Global Admin role or both of the following roles: Global Secure Access Admin, Security Admin.
- A Windows 11 device \(must be Entra joined or hybrid joined\) with internet access.

## Learning progression

Each lab builds on the previous one and follows a logical progression.
