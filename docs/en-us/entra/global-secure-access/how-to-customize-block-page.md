# How to customize Global Secure Access block page

## Overview

The custom block page empowers you to customize the default body of the page from, "It's been restricted by your organization." you configure and preview tailored messaging to coincide with your organization's style guide when internet access policies block a user's request to access an internet resource. Use custom block pages to display organization-specific messaging internet access policies block users from accessing websites.

## Prerequisites

- Configure [Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) inspection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-transport-layer-security).
- Configure [web content filtering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-web-content-filtering) and/or [threat intelligence filtering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-threat-intelligence).
- Ensure you have the [Global Secure Access Administrator role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) or equivalent role in Microsoft Entra ID assigned.

## Configure a custom block page

1. Navigate to **Global Secure Access** > **Settings** > **Session management** > **Custom Block Page**
2. Switch **Custom body message** to **On**.
3. Configure the Customized body message you would prefer. For example, `Your admin at Contoso has blocked your access.`
4. \(Optional\) Paste one or multiple clickable links via limited markdown language \(for example, `[click here](https://bing.com)`\).
5. Preview the customized message with the **Preview** button.
6. Select **Save** to save the custom block page.

Note

A known transient issue could result in the configuration failing. The current mitigation is to reconfigure the custom block page and try again.

## Verify the block page

1. From a device with the Global Secure Access client installed and the Internet Access traffic forwarding profile enabled, attempt to navigate to a site that your policy blocks.
2. Observe the block experience and confirm the custom messaging displays.
