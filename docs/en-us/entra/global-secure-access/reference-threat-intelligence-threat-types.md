# Global Secure Access Threat intelligence threat types

## Overview

When you set up threat intelligence rules blocking access to high severity threat sites, Microsoft assigns each transaction a threat type. This article provides a list of categories along with explanations.

Note

You can check a destination's threat type using the Threat Type column in Global Secure Access [Traffic Logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-view-traffic-logs). If you would like to report a false positive, in addition to adding a new rule, you can make a request via email using [this template](mailto:GSAThreatIntel@microsoft.com?subject=%5BCustomer%20Dispute%5D%20%3CDestination%3E%20is%20a%20false%20positive&body=Dispute%20Type%3A%20Threat%20intelligence%20false%20positive%0AURL%20OR%20FQDN%20OR%20IP%20%3A%20%3C%3E%0AThreat%20Type%20%3A%20%3C%3E%0AJustification%3A%20%3C%3E).
