# Customize the sign-in experience for your application with branding themes

You can create unique authentication experiences for applications in your tenant. Each application can have its own theme that you can customize with a background image or color, favicon, layout, header, and footer. This customization overrides any configurations made to the default branding. If you don't make any changes to the elements, the default elements are displayed.

This article describes how you can create multiple branding themes for different applications in your tenant.

Important

For external tenants, branding themes is generally available. For Microsoft Entra ID tenants, branding themes is in PREVIEW. This information relates to a prerelease product that may be substantially modified before it's released. Microsoft makes no warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

## Prerequisites

- For external tenants, there isn't a license requirement. For Microsoft Entra ID tenants, you must have an [Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing).
- Have at least the [Organizational Branding Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#organizational-branding-administrator) role.
- Have at least the [Application Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-administrator) role for applications that you want to apply a theme to.
- A registered application in your tenant. If you haven't registered an application yet, see [Register an application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app).
- Review the file size requirements for each image you want to add. Use a photo editor if needed to create correctly sized and formatted images: PNG, JPG, or JPEG with image size 245x36px and maximum file size 10KB.

## Branding theme properties

When you create a branding theme, here are some of the properties you can customize.

## How branding themes work

Branding themes build on neutral branding and default branding.

- **Branding theme** - Customizations of the default branding where you can have multiple themes.
- **Default branding \(company branding\)** - Customizations of the neutral branding for a tenant.
- **Neutral branding** - Initial branding for a tenant.

Here are some important things to know about how branding themes work.

- Branding themes can be applied to specific applications, while default branding applies tenant-wide.
- Default branding is used as fallback for any properties not defined in the branding theme.
- Neutral branding is used for any properties not defined in default branding.

## Limits and constraints

Here are some of the limits and constraints for branding themes.

- You can create up to 5 branding themes per tenant.
- The live preview capability previews style and layout changes and only shows the Sign in page. Live preview doesn't include any custom text overrides.
- You can't use the name **Default theme** for your branding theme name. This name is reserved.
- Custom text changes are currently limited to sign-in page only.
- If you don't update the banner logo property, the Microsoft logo is displayed instead of the tenant name \(neutral branding\).

## Create a new theme

     Important

     To align with the [Microsoft Secure Future Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative) and its focus on identity security and phishing resistance, Microsoft Entra ID is retiring support for custom CSS *layout and positioning properties* in company branding. After July 21, 2026, tenants created before January 6, 2026, that don't already use custom CSS can't configure custom CSS. Later, the properties will be deprecated globally and stop functioning. Eventually, custom CSS will be retired entirely. For the full list of deprecated properties and steps to update your CSS, see [CSS template reference guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/reference-company-branding-css-template#deprecation-of-custom-css-positioning-properties). For more information, see the blog post [Microsoft Entra ID enhances security of branded sign-ins](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-id-enhances-security-of-branded-sign-ins/4537471).

    On the **Sign-in** page, you can customize the **Display message box** text.

Anyone can see your sign-in page, so don't put sensitive info here. It has a maximum of 1024 characters.

    - Bold: `**text**` or `__text__`
