# Assign user roles with Microsoft Entra ID

The ability to manage resources is granted by assigning roles that provide the required permissions. Roles can be assigned to individual users or groups. To align with the [Zero Trust guiding principles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/zero-trust), use Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access policies when assigning roles.

This article provides instructions on how to assign roles directly to users in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

## Prerequisites

Before assigning roles to users, review the following Microsoft Learn articles:

- [Learn about Microsoft Entra roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/concept-understand-roles)
- [Learn about role based access control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles)
- [Explore the Azure built-in roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference)

To use Privileged Identity Management, you must have a Microsoft Entra ID P2 or Microsoft Entra ID Governance license. For more information on licensing, see [Microsoft Entra ID Governance licensing fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/licensing-fundamentals).

## Assign roles

If you need to assign a role directly to a user, you select the user, choose the role, and adjust the settings. While assigning roles directly to users might be necessary for one-off scenarios, consider using groups to manage role assignments at scale. For more information, see [Use group to manage role assignments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/groups-concept)

Eligible roles are assigned to a user but must be elevated Just-In-Time by the user through Privileged Identity Management \(PIM\). For more information about how to use PIM, see [Privileged Identity Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/).

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) as a [Privileged Role Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#privileged-role-administrator).
2. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Users**.
3. Search for and select the user getting the role assignment.

4. Select **Assigned roles** from the side menu, then select **Add assignments**.

5. Select a role to assign from the dropdown list and select the **Next** button.
6. Select an **Assignment type**.

   If your organization has a Microsoft Entra ID P2, Microsoft Entra ID Governance, or Microsoft Entra Suite license, you can assign roles as either *eligible* or *active*. If your organization has a Free or Microsoft Entra ID P1 license, you can only assign roles as *active*.

7. Leave the **Permanently eligible** option selected if the role should always be *available* to elevate for the user.

   If you uncheck this option, you can specify a date range for the role eligibility.
8. Select the **Assign** button.

   Assigned roles appear in the associated section for the user, so eligible and active roles are listed separately.

## Update roles

You can change the settings of a role assignment, for example to change an active role to eligible.

1. Browse to **Entra ID** > **Users**.
2. Search for and select the user getting their role updated.
3. Select **Assigned roles** from the side menu, then select either **Eligible assignments** or **Active assignments**.
4. Select the **Update** link for the role that needs to be changed.
