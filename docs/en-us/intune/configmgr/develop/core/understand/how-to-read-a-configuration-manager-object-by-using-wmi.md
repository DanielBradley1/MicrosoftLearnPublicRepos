# How to Read a Configuration Manager Object by Using WMI

In Configuration Manager, you read a Configuration Manager object by using the [SWbemServices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemservices) object [Get](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemservices-get) method to return an object instance that is identified by a key value.

Note

To query for multiple objects, use either a synchronous or asynchronous query. For more information, see [How to Perform a Synchronous Configuration Manager Query by Using Managed Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/configmgr/develop/core/understand/how-to-perform-a-synchronous-configuration-manager-query-by-using-managed-code)

### To read a Configuration Manager object

1. Set up a connection to the SMS Provider. For more information, see [How to Connect to an SMS Provider in Configuration Manager by Using WMI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/configmgr/develop/core/understand/how-to-connect-to-an-sms-provider-in-configuration-manager-by-using-wmi).
2. Using the SWbemServices object that you obtain from step 1, call the Get method and specify the class and key information for the object you want.

## Example

The following VBScript code example function displays the name and description for a supplied key package identifier \(`packageID`\).

For information about calling the sample code, see [Calling Configuration Manager Code Snippets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/configmgr/develop/core/understand/calling-code-snippets).

```vbs
Sub DisplayPackageName (connection, packageID)

    On Error Resume Next
    Dim package

    Set package = connection.Get("SMS_Package.PackageID='" & packageID & "'")
    If Err.Number<>0 Then
        Wscript.Echo "Couldn't get package " + packageID
        Exit Sub
    End If

    Wscript.Echo "Package Name: " + package.Name
    Wscript.Echo "Package Description: " + package.Description

End Sub
```

This example method has the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `connection` | [SWbemServices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/swbemservices) | A valid connection to the SMS Provider. |
| `packageID` | `String` | A package identifier. This can be obtained from the [SMS\_Package](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/configmgr/develop/reference/core/servers/configure/sms_package-server-wmi-class) class PackageID property. |
