# View device details

The **Device details** tab shows the read-only inventory that Intune collects from a managed device, including hardware, operating system, network, and storage information. It's one of the tabs on a device's **Overview** page, alongside **Monitor** \(status dashboards\), **Properties** \(editable settings\), and **Device action status**.

To view a device's details:

1. In the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), select [**Devices**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431#view/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/DevicesMenu/%7E/overview) > [**All devices**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431#view/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/DevicesMenu/%7E/allDevices).
2. From the devices list, select a device.
3. Select the **Device details** tab.

Tip

To change editable settings—such as the device name, ownership, primary user, notes, or scope tags—use the **Properties** tab. See [Edit device properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/device-management/inventory-and-status/edit-device-properties). To find installed apps, app configuration, BitLocker recovery keys, and other information, use the navigation pane on the device page—for example, [Discovered apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/app-management/discovered-apps) under **Reports**, or **BitLocker recovery keys** under **Tools**.

Note

Hardware and software inventory refreshes in the Intune service every seven days, starting from the date of enrollment.
