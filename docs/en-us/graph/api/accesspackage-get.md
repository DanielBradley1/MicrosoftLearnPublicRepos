# Get accessPackage

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve the properties and relationships of an [accessPackage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/accesspackage?view=graph-rest-1.0) object.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | EntitlementManagement.Read.All | EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | EntitlementManagement.Read.All | EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |

Tip

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned an administrator role with supported role permissions through one of the following options:

- A [role in the Entitlement Management system](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate) where the least privileged roles are:

  - *Catalog reader*. **This is the least privileged option**
  - *Catalog creator*
  - *Access package manager*

- More privileged [Microsoft Entra roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) supported for this operation:

  - Security Reader
  - Global Reader
  - Compliance Administrator
  - Security Administrator
  - Identity Governance Administrator

In app-only scenarios, the calling app can be assigned one of the preceding supported roles instead of the `EntitlementManagement.Read.All` application permission. The *Catalog reader* role is less privileged than the `EntitlementManagement.Read.All` application permission.

For more information, see [Delegation and roles in entitlement management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate) and [how to delegate access governance to access package managers in entitlement management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate-managers).

## HTTP request

```http
GET /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackages/{accessPackageId}
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select` [OData query parameter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters) to retrieve specific properties and the `$expand` parameter to retrieve relationships.

For example, to retrieve the access package assignment policies, add `$expand=assignmentPolicies`.

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
