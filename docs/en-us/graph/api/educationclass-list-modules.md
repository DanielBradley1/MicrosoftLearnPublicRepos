# List class modules

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a list of [module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationmodule?view=graph-rest-1.0) objects. Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

A teacher or an application with application permissions can see all module objects for the class. Students can only see published modules.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | EduCurricula.Read | EduCurricula.ReadWrite |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | EduCurricula.Read.All | EduCurricula.ReadWrite.All |
