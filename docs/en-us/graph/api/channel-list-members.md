# List members of a channel

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get a list of [members](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/conversationmember?view=graph-rest-1.0) in a [channel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/channel?view=graph-rest-1.0), including direct members of standard, private, and shared channels. Use the [List allMembers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/channel-list-allmembers?view=graph-rest-1.0) API to retrieve both direct and indirect members of a shared channel.

This method supports federation. Only a user who is a member of the shared channel can retrieve the channel member list.

Note

The membership IDs returned by server must be treated as opaque strings. The client should not try to parse or make any assumptions about these resource IDs.

The membership results could map to users from different tenants, as indicated in the response, in the future. The client should not assume that all members are from the current tenant only.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
