# List outcomes

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a list of [educationOutcome](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationoutcome?view=graph-rest-1.0) objects. There are four types of outcomes: **educationPointsOutcome**, **educationFeedbackOutcome**, **educationRubricOutcome**, and **educationFeedbackResourceOutcome**. Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

A submission for a credit assignment \(one that has no point value and no rubric\) has an [educationFeedbackOutcome](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationpointsoutcome?view=graph-rest-1.0). \(It might also return an [educationPointsOutcome](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationpointsoutcome?view=graph-rest-1.0), but that outcome is ignored.\)

A submission for a points assignment \(one that has a point value assigned\) has both an [educationFeedbackOutcome](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationpointsoutcome?view=graph-rest-1.0) and an [educationPointsOutcome](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationpointsoutcome?view=graph-rest-1.0).

A submission for an assignment with an attached rubric, if the rubric is a credit rubric \(no points\), has an [educationFeedbackOutcome](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationpointsoutcome?view=graph-rest-1.0) and an [educationRubricOutcome](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationrubricoutcome?view=graph-rest-1.0). \(It might also return an [educationPointsOutcome](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationpointsoutcome?view=graph-rest-1.0), but that outcome is ignored.\)

A submission for an assignment with an attached rubric, if the rubric is a points rubric, has an [educationFeedbackOutcome](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationpointsoutcome?view=graph-rest-1.0), an [educationPointsOutcome](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationpointsoutcome?view=graph-rest-1.0), and an [educationRubricOutcome](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationrubricoutcome?view=graph-rest-1.0).

A submission for a feedback resource has an [educationFeedbackResourceOutcome](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationfeedbackresourceoutcome?view=graph-rest-1.0).

All outcome types have a regular and a published property appropriate to that type of outcome; for example, **points** and **publishedPoints**, **feedback** and **publishedFeedback**. The regular property is the most recent value updated by the teacher; the published property is the most recent value returned to the student.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | EduAssignments.Read | EduAssignments.ReadWrite |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | EduAssignments.Read.All | EduAssignments.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

```http
GET /education/classes/{classId}/assignments/{assignmentId}/submissions/{submissionId}/outcomes
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$top`, `$filter`, and `$select` OData query parameters to help customize the response. For general information, see [OData query parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters).

All [properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationoutcome?view=graph-rest-1.0#properties) are supported for the query parameters `$filter` and `$orderby`.

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [educationOutcome](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationoutcome?view=graph-rest-1.0) objects in the response body.
