# List noncustodialSources

Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

Get the list of noncustodialSources associated with an [eDiscovery search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-ediscoverysearch?view=graph-rest-1.0).

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | eDiscovery.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | eDiscovery.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Purview role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/edisc-permissions) through one of the following options:

- **eDiscovery Manager**. Allows members to view and access eDiscovery cases they create, including searching and accessing case data. However, eDiscovery Managers can only access and manage the cases they create. **This is the least privileged option for managing their own cases**.
- **eDiscovery Administrator**. Provides all the permissions of eDiscovery Manager, plus the ability to view and access all eDiscovery cases in the organization.

Additional roles that provide read access to eDiscovery cases:

- **Compliance Administrator**. Includes Case Management and Compliance Search permissions.
- **Organization Management**. Includes Case Management and Compliance Search permissions.
- **Reviewer**. Provides read-only access to review sets within eDiscovery cases where the user is a member.

The eDiscovery Manager and eDiscovery Administrator roles are part of the Microsoft Purview role groups and provide access to eDiscovery features through [role-based access control \(RBAC\)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/edisc-permissions#rbac-roles-related-to-ediscovery).

For more information about eDiscovery permissions and roles, see [Assign permissions in eDiscovery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/edisc-permissions).
