# Get educationSubmission

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a particular [submission](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationsubmission?view=graph-rest-1.0). Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

A **submission** object represents a student's work for an [assignment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationassignment?view=graph-rest-1.0). Resources associated with the **submission** represent this work.

Only the **assignedTo** student can see and modify the **submission**. A teacher or application with application permissions has full access to all **submissions**.

The grade and feedback from a teacher are part of the [educationOutcome](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationoutcome?view=graph-rest-1.0) associated with this object. Only teachers or applications with application permissions can add or change grades and feedback. Students will not see the grade or feedback until the **assignment** has been released.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | EduAssignments.ReadBasic | EduAssignments.Read, EduAssignments.ReadWrite, EduAssignments.ReadWriteBasic |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | EduAssignments.ReadBasic.All | EduAssignments.Read.All, EduAssignments.ReadWrite.All, EduAssignments.ReadWriteBasic.All |

## HTTP request

```http
GET /education/classes/{class-id}/assignments/{assignment-id}/submissions/{submission-id}
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select` and `$orderby` OData query parameters to help customize the response. For general information, see [OData query parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters).

You can use `$orderby` with the following properties of the [educationSubmission](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationsubmission?view=graph-rest-1.0) resource: **excusedDateTime**, **reassignedDateTime**, **returnedDateTime**, **status**, **submittedDateTime**, and **unsubmittedDateTime**.

## Request headers

| Header | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an [educationSubmission](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationsubmission?view=graph-rest-1.0) object in the response body.
