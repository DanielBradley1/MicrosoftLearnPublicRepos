# Create educationSubmissionResource

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Add an [educationSubmissionResource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationsubmissionresource?view=graph-rest-1.0) to a submission resource list. Only teachers and students can perform this operation.

The operation will not succeed if the **allowStudentsToAddResources** flag is not set to `true`.

To create a new file-based resource, upload the file to the resources folder associated with the submission. If the file doesn't exist or is not in that folder, the POST request will fail.

Important

Before you can upload an assignment resource, you must [set up the resources folder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/educationassignment-setupresourcesfolder?view=graph-rest-1.0) for the [educationAssignment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationassignment?view=graph-rest-1.0) to upload the files to.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | EduAssignments.ReadWriteBasic | EduAssignments.ReadWrite |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Not supported. | Not supported. |

## HTTP request

```http
POST /education/classes/{class-id}/assignments/{assignment-id}/submissions/{submission-id}/resources
```

## Request headers

| Header | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| Content-Type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the resource. The following are the supported types:

- [educationExcelResource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationexcelresource?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- [educationFileResource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationfileresource?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- [educationLinkResource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationlinkresource?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- [educationPowerPointResource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationpowerpointresource?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- [educationWordResource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationwordresource?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- [educationMediaResource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationmediaresource?view=graph-rest-1.0).

> **Note:** The [educationExternalResource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationexternalresource?view=graph-rest-1.0) is only an out resource, you can't POST a submission with it.

The `assignmentResourceUrl` isn't required in the request body; it's a read-only property.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an object according to the resource type in the response body.
