# List oauth2PermissionGrants \(delegated permission grants\)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a list of [oAuth2PermissionGrant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/oauth2permissiongrant?view=graph-rest-1.0) objects, representing delegated permissions which have been granted for client applications to access APIs on behalf of signed-in users.

Note

This request might have replication delays for delegated permission grants that were recently created, updated, or deleted. This delay will be minimized if a filter on `clientId` is specified. Learn more in [Designing for eventual consistency for Microsoft Entra](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/identity/designing-for-eventual-consistency-for-microsoft-entra/).

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | Directory.Read.All | DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Directory.Read.All | DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. This operation supports the following built-in roles, which provide only the least privilege necessary:

- Global Reader
- Directory Readers
- Application Administrator
- Application Developer
- Cloud Application Administrator
- Directory Writers
- Privileged Role Administrator
- User Administrator
