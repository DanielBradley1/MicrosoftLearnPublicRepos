# List accessPackageAssignmentRequests

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

In [Microsoft Entra entitlement management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/entitlementmanagement-overview?view=graph-rest-beta), retrieve a list of [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest?view=graph-rest-beta) objects. The resulting list includes all the assignment requests, current and well as expired, that the caller has access to read, across all catalogs and access packages.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | EntitlementManagement.Read.All | EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | EntitlementManagement.Read.All | EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |

Tip

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned an administrator role with supported role permissions through one of the following options:

- A [role in the Entitlement Management system](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate) where the least privileged roles are:

  - *Catalog reader*. **This is the least privileged option**
  - *Catalog creator*
  - *Access package manager*

- More privileged [Microsoft Entra roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) supported for this operation:

  - Security Reader
  - Global Reader
  - Compliance Administrator
  - Security Administrator
  - Identity Governance Administrator

In app-only scenarios, the calling app can be assigned one of the preceding supported roles instead of the `EntitlementManagement.Read.All` application permission. The *Catalog reader* role is less privileged than the `EntitlementManagement.Read.All` application permission.

For more information, see [Delegation and roles in entitlement management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate) and [how to delegate access governance to access package managers in entitlement management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate-managers).

## HTTP request

Note

This API will be retired soon. Use the [List assignmentRequests](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/entitlementmanagement-list-assignmentrequests?view=graph-rest-beta) API instead.

```http
GET /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageAssignmentRequests
```

## Query parameters

This method supports the `$select`, `$expand` and `$filter` OData query parameters to help customize the response.

If the user or application only has permissions within a specific catalog or catalogs, you must include in the query a filter which specifies an access package, such as `$expand=accessPackage&$filter=accessPackage/id eq '9bbe5f7d-f1e7-4eb1-a586-38cdf6f8b1ea'`.

### Example scenarios for using query parameters

- To retrieve the access package of each request, include `$expand=accessPackage` in the query.
- To retrieve the resulting assignment, include `$expand=accessPackageAssignment` in the query.
- To obtain more details on the requestor, include `$expand=requestor` in the query.

For general information, see [OData query parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters).

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest?view=graph-rest-beta) objects in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

The following example shows a request. The request URI includes `$filter` to only return requests in a particular state, and `$expand` to return details of the requestor and their connected organization as well.
