# Delete identityProvider from b2xIdentityUserFlow

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Delete an identity provider from a [b2xIdentityUserFlow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/b2xidentityuserflow?view=graph-rest-1.0) object. For self-service sign-up user flows, the values can be `Google-OAUTH` or `Facebook-OAUTH`.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | IdentityUserFlow.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | IdentityUserFlow.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. *External ID User Flow Administrator* is the least privileged role supported for this operation.
