# List authenticationStrengthPolicies

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get a list of the [authenticationStrengthPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/authenticationstrengthpolicy?view=graph-rest-1.0) objects and their properties. This API returns both built-in and custom policies.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | Policy.Read.AuthenticationMethod | Policy.Read.All, Policy.ReadWrite.AuthenticationMethod, Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Policy.Read.AuthenticationMethod | Policy.Read.All, Policy.ReadWrite.AuthenticationMethod, Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. This operation supports the following built-in roles, which provide only the least privilege necessary:

- Conditional Access administrator
- Security Administrator
- Security Reader

## HTTP request

```http
GET /policies/authenticationStrengthPolicies
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$filter` OData query parameter on the **policyType** and **policyName** properties to help customize the response. For general information, see [OData query parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters).

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [authenticationStrengthPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/authenticationstrengthpolicy?view=graph-rest-1.0) objects in the response body.
