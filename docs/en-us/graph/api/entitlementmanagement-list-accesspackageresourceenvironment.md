# List accessPackageResourceEnvironments

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieve a list of [accessPackageResourceEnvironment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/accesspackageresourceenvironment?view=graph-rest-beta) objects and their properties.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | EntitlementManagement.Read.All | EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | EntitlementManagement.Read.All | EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |

Tip

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned an administrator role with supported role permissions through one of the following options:

- A [role in the Entitlement Management system](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate) where the least privileged roles are:

  - *Catalog reader*. **This is the least privileged option**
  - *Catalog creator*
  - *Access package manager*

- More privileged [Microsoft Entra roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) supported for this operation:

  - Security Reader
  - Global Reader
  - Compliance Administrator
  - Security Administrator
  - Identity Governance Administrator

In app-only scenarios, the calling app can be assigned one of the preceding supported roles instead of the `EntitlementManagement.Read.All` application permission. The *Catalog reader* role is less privileged than the `EntitlementManagement.Read.All` application permission.

For more information, see [Delegation and roles in entitlement management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate) and [how to delegate access governance to access package managers in entitlement management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate-managers).

## HTTP request

```http
GET identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageResourceEnvironments?$filter=originSystem eq 'SharePointOnline'
```

## Query parameters

This method requires the `$filter` [OData query parameter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters). You must apply `$filter` to retrieve the **originSystem** that's assigned the value `SharePointOnline`.

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [accessPackageResourceEnvironment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/accesspackageresourceenvironment?view=graph-rest-beta) objects in the response body.

Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version.
