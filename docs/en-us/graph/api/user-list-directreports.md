# List directReports

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get a user's direct reports. Returns the users and contacts for whom this user is assigned as manager. This API doesn't support getting the direct report chain beyond the specified user's direct reports.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | User.Read and User.ReadBasic.All | Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, User.Read.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | User.Read.All | User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

Important

When an application queries a relationship that returns a **directoryObject** type collection, if it doesn't have permission to read a certain resource type, members of that type are returned but with limited information. For example, only the **@odata.type** property for the object type and the **id** is returned, while other properties are indicated as `null`. With this behavior, applications can request the least privileged permissions they need, rather than rely on the set of *Directory.*\* permissions. For details, see [Limited information returned for inaccessible member objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#limited-information-returned-for-inaccessible-member-objects).

## HTTP request

To retrieve the direct reports of a user:

```http
GET /me/directReports
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/directReports
```

Note

Calling the `/me` endpoint requires a signed-in user and therefore a delegated permission. Application permissions aren't supported when using the `/me` endpoint.

To retrieve the user and their direct reports, use the `$expand` query parameter:

> **Note**: `$expand` returns a maximum of 20 objects. For details, see [query parameter limitations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues#some-limitations-apply-to-query-parameters).

```http
GET /me?$expand=directReports
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}?$expand=directReports
```

Note

Calling the `/me` endpoint requires a signed-in user and therefore a delegated permission. Application permissions aren't supported when using the `/me` endpoint.

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select`, `$count`, `$expand`, and `$filter` [OData query parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. You can use `$select` nested in the `$expand` expression. For example, `me?$expand=($select=id,displayName)`. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## Request headers

| Header | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| Content-Type | application/json |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or in specific usage of `$filter`. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [directoryObject](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/directoryobject?view=graph-rest-1.0) objects in the response body.
