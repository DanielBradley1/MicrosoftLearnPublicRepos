# List approvalSteps

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

List the [approvalStep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/approvalstep?view=graph-rest-beta) objects associated with an [approval](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/approval?view=graph-rest-beta). This API request is made by an approver in the following scenarios:

- In [entitlement management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/entitlementmanagement-overview?view=graph-rest-beta), providing the identifier of the [access package assignment request](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest?view=graph-rest-beta).
- In [PIM for Microsoft Entra roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/privilegedidentitymanagementv3-overview?view=graph-rest-beta), providing the identifier of the [role assignment schedule request](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/unifiedroleassignmentschedulerequest?view=graph-rest-beta).
- In [PIM for Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/privilegedidentitymanagement-for-groups-api-overview?view=graph-rest-beta), providing the identifier of the [assignment schedule request](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/privilegedaccessgroupassignmentschedulerequest?view=graph-rest-beta).

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

The following tables show the least privileged permission or permissions required to call this API on each supported resource type. Follow [best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions) to request least privileged permissions. For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

### For entitlement management

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | EntitlementManagement.Read.All | EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Not supported. | Not supported. |

Tip

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned an administrator role with supported role permissions through one of the following options:

- A [role in the Entitlement Management system](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate) where the least privileged roles are:

  - *Catalog reader*. **This is the least privileged option**
  - *Catalog creator*
  - *Access package manager*

- More privileged [Microsoft Entra roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) supported for this operation:

  - Security Reader
  - Global Reader
  - Compliance Administrator
  - Security Administrator
  - Identity Governance Administrator

In app-only scenarios, the calling app can be assigned one of the preceding supported roles instead of the `EntitlementManagement.Read.All` application permission. The *Catalog reader* role is less privileged than the `EntitlementManagement.Read.All` application permission.

For more information, see [Delegation and roles in entitlement management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate) and [how to delegate access governance to access package managers in entitlement management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate-managers).

### For PIM for Microsoft Entra roles

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | RoleAssignmentSchedule.Read.Directory | RoleAssignmentSchedule.ReadWrite.Directory |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Not supported. | Not supported. |

### For PIM for Groups

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | PrivilegedAssignmentSchedule.Read.AzureADGroup | PrivilegedAssignmentSchedule.ReadWrite.AzureADGroup |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Not supported. | Not supported. |

## HTTP request

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of the [approvalStep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/approvalstep?view=graph-rest-beta) objects in the response body. However, if the caller doesn't have the right permissions, the method returns a `403 Forbidden` response code.
