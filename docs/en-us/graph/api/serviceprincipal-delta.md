# servicePrincipal: delta

Get newly created, updated, or deleted service principals without having to perform a full read of the entire resource collection. For more information, see [Use delta query to track changes in Microsoft Graph data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/delta-query-overview) for details.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | Directory.Read.All | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts where the signed-in user is acting on another user, they must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. This operation supports the following built-in roles, which provide only the least privilege necessary:

- A non-admin member or guest user with default user permissions
- Application Developer - read properties of service principals they own
- Directory Readers - read standard properties
- Global Reader
- Directory Writers
- Hybrid Identity Administrator
- Security Administrator
- Cloud Application Administrator
- Application Administrator

## HTTP request

To begin tracking changes, you make a request by including the delta function on the servicePrincipal resource.

```http
GET /servicePrincipals/delta
```

## Query parameters

Tracking changes incurs a round of one or more **delta** function calls. If you use any query parameter \(other than `$deltatoken` and `$skiptoken`\), you must specify it in the initial **delta** request. Microsoft Graph automatically encodes any specified parameters into the token portion of the `@odata.nextLink` or `@odata.deltaLink` URL provided in the response. You only need to specify any desired query parameters once upfront. In subsequent requests, copy and apply the `@odata.nextLink` or `@odata.deltaLink` URL from the previous response, as that URL already includes the encoded, desired parameters.

| Query parameter | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $deltatoken | string | A [state token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `@odata.deltaLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call for the same resource collection, indicating the completion of that round of change tracking. Save and apply the entire `@odata.deltaLink` URL including this token in the first request of the next round of change tracking for that collection. |
| $skiptoken | string | A [state token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `@odata.nextLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call, indicating there are further changes to be tracked in the same resource collection. |

### Optional query parameters

This method supports OData query parameters to help customize the response.

- You can use a `$select` query parameter as in any GET request to specify only the properties your need for best performance. The *id* property is always returned.
- There's limited support for `$filter`:

  - The only supported `$filter` expression is for tracking changes for specific resources, by their ID: `$filter=id+eq+{value}` or `$filter=id+eq+{value1}+or+id+eq+{value2}`. The number of IDs you can specify is limited by the maximum URL length.

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

### Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and [servicePrincipal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal?view=graph-rest-1.0) collection object in the response body. The response also includes a nextLink URL or a deltaLink URL.

- If a `@odata.nextLink` URL is returned, there are more pages of data to be retrieved in the session. The application continues making requests by using the `@odata.nextLink` URL until a `@odata.deltaLink` URL is included in the response.
- If a `@odata.deltaLink` URL is returned, there's no more data about the existing state of the resource to be returned. Persist and use the `@odata.deltaLink` URL to learn about changes to the resource in the future.
