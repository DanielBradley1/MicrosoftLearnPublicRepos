# accessPackageResource: refresh

Namespace: microsoft.graph

In [Microsoft Entra entitlement management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/entitlementmanagement-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0), refresh the [accessPackageResource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/accesspackageresource?view=graph-rest-1.0) object to fetch the latest details for **displayName**, **description**, and **resourceType** from the origin system. For the `AadApplication` originSystem, this operation also updates the **displayName** and **description** for the [accessPackageResourceRole](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/accesspackageresourcerole?view=graph-rest-1.0).

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |

Tip

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned an administrator role with supported role permissions through one of the following options:

- A [role in the Entitlement Management system](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate) where the least privileged roles are:

  - *Access package manager*. **This is the least privileged option**
  - Catalog owner

- More privileged [Microsoft Entra roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) supported for this operation:

  - Identity Governance Administrator

In app-only scenarios, the calling app can be assigned one of the preceding supported roles instead of the `EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All` application permission. The *Access package manager* role is less privileged than the `EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All` application permission.
