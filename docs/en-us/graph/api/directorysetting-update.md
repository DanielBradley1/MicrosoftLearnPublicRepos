# Update directorySetting

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update the properties of a specific [directory setting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/directorysetting?view=graph-rest-beta) object.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

The following tables show the least privileged permission or permissions required to call this API on each supported resource type. Follow [best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions) to request least privileged permissions. For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

### For all settings *except* the Consent Policy Settings object

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | GroupSettings.ReadWrite.All | Directory.ReadWrite.All, Policy.ReadWrite.Authorization |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | GroupSettings.ReadWrite.All | Directory.ReadWrite.All, Policy.ReadWrite.Authorization |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. This operation supports the following built-in roles, which provide only the least privilege necessary:

- Read basic properties on setting templates and settings - *Microsoft Entra Joined Device Local Administrator*, *Directory Readers*, *Global Reader*
- Manage all group/directory settings - *Directory Writers*
- Manage global and local settings for groups; manage `Group.Unified.Guest` and `Group.Unified` settings - *Groups Administrator*
- Update `Password Rule Settings` - *Authentication Policy Administrator*
- Update settings, Read basic properties on setting templates and settings - *User Administrator*

When an app is granted delegated *Directory.Read.All* or *Directory.ReadWrite.All* permissions, the signed-in user only needs the default member role. No additional Microsoft Entra role is required. The Microsoft Entra roles listed above are required only when the calling app is granted a more limited delegated permission, such as *GroupSettings.Read.All*. In that case, the signed-in user must hold one of the listed roles.

### For the Consent Policy Settings object

The following permissions are required to update the "Consent Policy Settings" **directorySetting** object.

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | GroupSettings.ReadWrite.All | Directory.ReadWrite.All, Policy.ReadWrite.Authorization |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | GroupSettings.ReadWrite.All | Directory.ReadWrite.All, Policy.ReadWrite.Authorization |

## HTTP request

Update a tenant-wide setting.

```http
PATCH /settings/{directorySettingId}
```

Update a group-specific setting.

```http
PATCH /groups/{groupId}/settings/{directorySettingId}
```

## Optional request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated.

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| values | [settingValue](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/settingvalue?view=graph-rest-beta) collection | The updated set of values. NOTE: You must supply the entire collection set. You cannot update a single set of values. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code.

## Example 2: Enable sensitivity labels for all cloud security groups in the tenant

Use the `Group.Security` template \(`d209f6fa-3839-4d70-b83f-60b1c64d0e8f`\) to enable MIP sensitivity labels for all cloud security groups and keep the preexisting setting for `AllowToAddGuests`. You must have already [created a **directorySetting** object](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/group-post-settings?view=graph-rest-beta) from this template; replace the identifier in the URL with the ID of the existing **directorySetting** object.

This feature requires a Microsoft Entra ID P1 license.
