# Add member to team

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Add a new [conversationMember](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/conversationmember?view=graph-rest-1.0) to a [team](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/team?view=graph-rest-1.0).

Note

- The **roles** property is empty by default for all members. This property only contains additional qualifiers when relevant; for example, if the member has `owner` privileges, the **roles** property contains `owner` as one of the values. Similarly, if the member is a guest, the **roles** property contains `guest` as one of the values. A basic member shouldn't have any values specified in the **roles** property.
- After adding a new [conversation member](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/conversationmember?view=graph-rest-1.0) to a [team](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/team?view=graph-rest-1.0), it might take some time for the addition to be reflected. Users can use [change notifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/change-notifications-api-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0) to subscribe to notifications for membership changes in a particular team.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | TeamMember.ReadWriteNonOwnerRole.All | TeamMember.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | TeamMember.ReadWriteNonOwnerRole.All | TeamMember.ReadWrite.All |

Note

Using application permissions to [add guest members](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-guest-users?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true) to a team is not supported.

## HTTP request

```http
POST /teams/{team-id}/members
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| Content-Type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [conversationMember](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/conversationmember?view=graph-rest-1.0) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [conversationMember](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/conversationmember?view=graph-rest-1.0) object in the response body.

For best results, stagger calls with a 2-second buffer.

Note

The response code `404 Not Found` is returned when you attempt to add a disabled/blocked user.
