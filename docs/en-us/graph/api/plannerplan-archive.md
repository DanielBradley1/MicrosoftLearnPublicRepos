# plannerPlan: archive

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Archive a [plannerPlan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/plannerplan?view=graph-rest-beta) object. Archiving a plan, also archives the [plannerTasks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/plannertask?view=graph-rest-beta) and [plannerBuckets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/plannerbucket?view=graph-rest-beta) in the plan.

An archived entity is read-only. Archived entities cannot be updated.

An archived plan can be [unarchived](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/plannerplan-unarchive?view=graph-rest-beta).

All archived entities can be deleted.

Archived tasks are not included in the response for [list of tasks assigned to a user](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/planneruser-list-tasks?view=graph-rest-beta).

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-Type | application/json. Required. |
| If-Match | Last known ETag value for the **plannerPlan** to be archived. Required. |

## Request body

The following table lists the parameters that are required when you call this action.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
