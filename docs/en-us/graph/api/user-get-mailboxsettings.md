# Get user mailbox settings

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get the user's [mailboxSettings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/mailboxsettings?view=graph-rest-1.0). You can view all mailbox settings, or get specific settings.

Users can set the following settings for their mailboxes through an Outlook client:

- [automatic replies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/automaticrepliessetting?view=graph-rest-1.0) \(notify people automatically upon receipt of their email\)
- date format
- delegateMeetingMessageDeliveryOptions
- [locale](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/localeinfo?view=graph-rest-1.0) \(language and country/region\)
- time format
- time zone
- [working hours](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/workinghours?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- [user purpose](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/mailboxsettings?view=graph-rest-1.0#userpurpose-values)

Users can set their preferred date and time formats using Outlook on the web. Users can choose one of the supported [short date](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings#ShortDate) or [short time](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings#ShortTime) formats. This `GET` operation returns the format the user has chosen.

Users can set the time zone they prefer on any Outlook client, by choosing from the [supported time zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/outlookuser-supportedtimezones?view=graph-rest-1.0) that their administrator has set up for their mailbox server. The administrator can set up time zones in the Windows time zone format or [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority \(IANA\) time zone](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) \(also known as Olson time zone\) format. The Windows format is the default.

This `GET` operation returns the user's preferred time zone in the format that the administrator has set up. If you want that time zone to be in a specific format \(Windows or IANA\), you can first [update the preferred time zone in that format as a mailbox setting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-update-mailboxsettings?view=graph-rest-1.0). Subsequently you will be able to get the time zone in that format. Alternatively, you can manage the format conversion separately in your app.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | MailboxSettings.Read | MailboxSettings.ReadWrite |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | MailboxSettings.Read | MailboxSettings.ReadWrite |
| Application | MailboxSettings.Read | MailboxSettings.ReadWrite |

## HTTP request

To get all the mailbox settings for a user:

```http
GET /me/mailboxSettings
GET /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/mailboxSettings
```

To get specific settings - only the automatic replies settings, date format, locale, time format, time zone, working hours, or user's recipient or mailbox type \(for example, user purpose\):

```http
GET /me/mailboxSettings/automaticRepliesSetting
GET /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/mailboxSettings/automaticRepliesSetting

GET /me/mailboxSettings/dateFormat
GET /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/mailboxSettings/dateFormat

GET /me/mailboxSettings/delegateMeetingMessageDeliveryOptions

GET /me/mailboxSettings/workingHours
GET /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/mailboxSettings/workingHours

GET /me/mailboxSettings/userPurpose
GET /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/mailboxSettings/userPurpose
```
