# servicePrincipal: getPasswordSingleSignOnCredentials

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get a list of single sign-on credentials using a password for a user or group.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | Application.ReadWrite.All and Directory.Read.All | Directory.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy and Directory.Read.All | Directory.Read.All and Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. This operation supports the following built-in roles, which provide only the least privilege necessary:

- Users can create and manage credentials for themselves
- Application Administrator
- Cloud Application Administrator

## HTTP request

You can address the service principal using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application \(Client\) ID**, respectively, in app registrations in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

```http
POST /servicePrincipals/{id}/getPasswordSingleSignOnCredentials
POST /servicePrincipals(appId='{appId}')/getPasswordSingleSignOnCredentials
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| Content-Type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, provide a JSON object with the following parameters.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id | String | The ID of the user or group this credential set belongs to. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a new [passwordSingleSignOnCredentialSet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/passwordsinglesignoncredentialset?view=graph-rest-beta) object in the response body.
