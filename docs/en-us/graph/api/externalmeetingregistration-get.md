# Get externalMeetingRegistration \(deprecated\)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Caution

The external meeting registration API is deprecated and will stop returning data on **December 12, 2024**. Please use the new [webinar APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/virtualeventwebinar?view=graph-rest-beta). For more information, see [Deprecation of the Microsoft Graph meeting registration beta APIs](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/deprecation-of-the-microsoft-graph-meeting-registration-beta-apis/).

Get the [externalMeetingRegistration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/externalmeetingregistration?view=graph-rest-beta) details associated with an [onlineMeeting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/onlinemeeting?view=graph-rest-beta).

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | OnlineMeetings.Read | OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Not supported. | Not supported. |

To use application permission for this API, tenant administrators must create an [application access policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/cloud-communication-online-meeting-application-access-policy) and grant it to a user to authorize the app configured in the policy to fetch online meetings and/or online meeting artifacts on behalf of that user \(with user ID specified in the request path\).

## HTTP request

To get external meeting registration with delegated \(`/me`\) and app \(`/users/{userId}/`\) permission:

```http
GET /me/onlineMeetings/{meetingId}/registration
GET /users/{userId}/onlineMeetings/{meetingId}/registration
```

Tip

- `userId` is the **objectId** of the meeting organizer.
- `meetingId` is the **id** of the [onlineMeeting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/onlinemeeting?view=graph-rest-beta) object.

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData query parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
