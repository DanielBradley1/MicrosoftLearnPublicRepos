# driveItem: removeRetentionLabel

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Remove the retention label from a [driveItem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/driveitem?view=graph-rest-1.0). This operation clears the retention label and all associated retention settings enforced on the item.

For information about retention labels from an administrator's perspective, see [Use retention labels to manage the lifecycle of documents stored in SharePoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/auto-apply-retention-labels-scenario).

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | Files.ReadWrite.All | Sites.FullControl.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Files.ReadWrite.All | Sites.ReadWrite.All |

Note

- `Sites.FullControl.All` is the least privileged permission required to remove retention labels that classify the content as records in SharePoint Online and OneDrive.
- In SharePoint Online and OneDrive, removal of a *Record* retention label isn't supported when using app-only authentication. This operation requires a delegated user context.
- In *SharePoint Embedded*, removal of any retention label isn't supported when using app-only authentication. This operation requires a delegated user context.

Note

SharePoint Embedded requires the `FileStorageContainer.Selected` permission to access the content of the container. This permission is different from the ones mentioned previously. In addition to Microsoft Graph permissions, your app must have the necessary [container type permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/embedded/development/auth#container-type-application-permissions) to call this API. For more information, see [SharePoint Embedded authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/app-concepts/auth).
