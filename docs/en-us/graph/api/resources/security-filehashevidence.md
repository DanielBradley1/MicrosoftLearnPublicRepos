# fileHashEvidence resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

Represents a file hash value that is reported in a security detection alert, usually in relation to a file entity instance.

Inherits from [alertEvidence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-alertevidence?view=graph-rest-1.0).

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| algorithm | [microsoft.graph.security.fileHashAlgorithm](#filehashalgorithm-values) | The hash algorithm type. Possible values are: `unknown`, `md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`, `sha256ac`, `unknownFutureValue`. |
| createdDateTime | DateTimeOffset | The date and time when the evidence was created and added to the alert. The timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2024 is `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Inherited from [alertEvidence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-alertevidence?view=graph-rest-1.0). |
| detailedRoles | String collection | Detailed description of the entity role or roles in an alert. Values are free-form. Inherited from [alertEvidence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-alertevidence?view=graph-rest-1.0). |
| remediationStatus | [microsoft.graph.security.evidenceRemediationStatus](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-alertevidence?view=graph-rest-1.0#evidenceremediationstatus-values) | Status of the remediation action taken. The possible values are: `none`, `remediated`, `prevented`, `blocked`, `notFound`, `unknownFutureValue`, `active`, `pendingApproval`, `declined`, `unremediated`, `running`, `partiallyRemediated`. Use the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` request header to get the following values from this [evolvable enum](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/best-practices-concept#handling-future-members-in-evolvable-enumerations): `active`, `pendingApproval`, `declined`, `unremediated`, `running`, `partiallyRemediated`. Inherited from [alertEvidence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-alertevidence?view=graph-rest-1.0). |
| remediationStatusDetails | String | Details about the remediation status. Inherited from [alertEvidence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-alertevidence?view=graph-rest-1.0). |
| roles | [microsoft.graph.security.evidenceRole](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-alertevidence?view=graph-rest-1.0#evidencerole-values) collection | The role or roles that an evidence entity represents in an alert, for example, an IP address that is associated with an attacker has the evidence role **Attacker**. Inherited from [alertEvidence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-alertevidence?view=graph-rest-1.0). |
| tags | String collection | Array of custom tags associated with an evidence instance, for example, to denote a group of devices and high-value assets. Inherited from [alertEvidence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-alertevidence?view=graph-rest-1.0). |
| value | String | The hash value. |
| verdict | [microsoft.graph.security.evidenceVerdict](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-alertevidence?view=graph-rest-1.0#evidenceverdict-values) | The decision reached by automated investigation. The possible values are: `unknown`, `suspicious`, `malicious`, `noThreatsFound`, `unknownFutureValue`. Inherited from [alertEvidence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-alertevidence?view=graph-rest-1.0). |

### fileHashAlgorithm values

| Member | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| unknown | An unknown hash algorithm that is used for forward compatibility. |
| md5 | The MD5 hash type. |
| sha1 | The SHA1 hash type. |
| sha256 | The SHA256 hash type. |
| sha256ac | The SHA256 authenticode hash type. |
| unknownFutureValue | Evolvable enumeration sentinel value. Don't use. |
