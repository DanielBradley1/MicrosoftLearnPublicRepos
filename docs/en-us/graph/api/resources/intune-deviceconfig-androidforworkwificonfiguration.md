# androidForWorkWiFiConfiguration resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> **Important:** Microsoft supports Intune /beta APIs, but they are subject to more frequent change. Microsoft recommends using version v1.0 when possible. Check an API's availability in version v1.0 using the Version selector.

> **Note:** The Microsoft Graph API for Intune requires an [active Intune license](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) for the tenant.

By providing the configurations in this profile you can instruct the Android for Work device to connect to desired Wi-Fi endpoint. By specifying the authentication method and security types expected by Wi-Fi endpoint you can make the Wi-Fi connection seamless for end user. This profile provides limited and simpler security types than Enterprise Wi-Fi profile.
