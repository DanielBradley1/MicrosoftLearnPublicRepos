# cloudPcSnapshotImportActionResult resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Represents the result of the [snapshot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/cloudpcsnapshot?view=graph-rest-beta) import action. Each action has a status and can be tracked individually. When the action returns a succeeded status, the snapshot is ready for use in Cloud PC provisioning.

Windows 365 administrators must prepare a provisioning policy and assign it to users as a requirement for snapshot import.
