# Use the Outlook mail REST API

Microsoft Graph lets your app get authorized access to a user's Outlook mail data in a personal or organization account. With the appropriate delegated or application [mail permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#mail-permissions), your app can access the mail data of the signed-in user or any user in a tenant. For more information on access tokens, app registration, and delegated and application permissions, see [Authentication and authorization basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts).

The Microsoft Graph API supports accessing data in users' *primary* mailboxes and in [shared mailboxes](https://support.office.com/article/open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-outlook-d94a8e9e-21f1-4240-808b-de9c9c088afd). The data can be calendar, mail, or personal contacts stored in a mailbox in the cloud on Exchange Online as part of Microsoft 365, or on Exchange on-premises in a [hybrid deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/hybrid-rest-support).

The API does *not* support accessing in-place archive mailboxes, not [on Exchange Online](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/enable-archive-mailboxes) nor [on Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/Exchange/policy-and-compliance/in-place-archiving/in-place-archiving?view=exchserver-2019&preserve-view=true).

## Using the mail REST API

Mail API requests are performed on behalf of a [user](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-1.0) which can be identified by the user's **id** property \(a unique GUID\), email address, or the `me` shortcut alias for the signed-in user.

Email messages are represented by the [message](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/message?view=graph-rest-1.0) resource and organized in a [mailFolder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/mailfolder?view=graph-rest-1.0). Messages and mail folders are identified by their **id** property, obtainable from `GET` operations.

Important

In general, do not assume that **message** and **mailfolder** IDs are unique and always remain the same within a mailbox. They might change after certain actions such as copy or move. You can choose to use [immutable IDs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/outlook-immutable-id) to retain the same ID as long as the message remains in the same mailbox, *with the exception of sending a draft message, and a few other scenarios*. See [lifetime of immutable IDs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/outlook-immutable-id#lifetime-of-immutable-ids) for details.

Message bodies can be in HTML or text format.

You can use well-known folder names such as `Inbox`, `Drafts`, `SentItems`, or `DeletedItems` to identify certain mail folders that exist by default for all users. For a list of supported well-known folder names, see [mailFolder resource type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/mailfolder?view=graph-rest-1.0).

For example, you can get messages in the Outlook **Sent Items** folder of the signed-in user, without first getting the folder ID:

```http
GET /me/mailFolders('SentItems')/messages?$select=sender,subject
```

When a message is updated while open in an Outlook client, the client does not refresh the message. Users must reopen the message to view the changes.

## Common use cases

The **message** resource exposes properties such as **categories**, **conversationId**, **flag**, and **importance** that correspond to features available in the UI, allowing apps to automate or integrate with the built-in Outlook user experience.

The Microsoft Graph API also provides methods and actions that support common use cases of messages.
