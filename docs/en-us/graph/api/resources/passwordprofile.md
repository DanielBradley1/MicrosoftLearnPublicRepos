# passwordProfile resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Contains the password profile associated with a user. The **passwordProfile** property of the [user](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-1.0) entity is a **passwordProfile** object. See an example to [Update the passwordProfile of a user](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-update?view=graph-rest-1.0#example-3-update-the-passwordprofile-of-a-user-and-reset-their-password).

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| forceChangePasswordNextSignIn | Boolean | `true` if the user must change their password on the next sign-in; otherwise `false`. |
| forceChangePasswordNextSignInWithMfa | Boolean | If `true`, at next sign-in, the user must perform a multifactor authentication \(MFA\) before being forced to change their password. The behavior is identical to **forceChangePasswordNextSignIn** except that the user is required to first perform a multifactor authentication before password change. After a password change, this property will be automatically reset to `false`. If not set, default is `false`. |
| password | String | The password for the user. This property is required when a user is created. It can be updated, but the user will be required to change the password on the next sign-in. The password must satisfy minimum requirements as specified by the user's **passwordPolicies** property. By default, a strong password is required. |
