# event resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

An event in a [user](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-1.0) calendar, or the default calendar of a Microsoft 365 [group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0).

The maximum number of attendees included in an **event**, and the maximum number of recipients in an [eventMessage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/eventmessage?view=graph-rest-1.0) sent from an Exchange Online mailbox is 500. For more information, see [sending limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#sending-limits).

This resource supports:

- Adding your own data to custom properties as [extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/extensibility-overview).
- Subscribing to [change notifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/change-notifications-overview).
- Using [delta query](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/event-delta?view=graph-rest-1.0) function.

> **Note:** There are a few minor differences in the way you can interact with user calendars, group calendars, and their events:

- You can organize only user calendars in a [calendarGroup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/calendargroup?view=graph-rest-1.0).
- You can add [attachment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/attachment?view=graph-rest-1.0) objects to events in only user calendars, but not to events in group calendars.
- Outlook automatically accepts all meeting requests on behalf of groups. You can [accept](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/event-accept?view=graph-rest-1.0), [tentatively accept](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/event-tentativelyaccept?view=graph-rest-1.0), or [decline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/event-decline?view=graph-rest-1.0) meeting requests for *user* calendars only.
- Outlook doesn't support reminders for group events. You can [snooze](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/event-snoozereminder?view=graph-rest-1.0) or [dismiss](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/event-dismissreminder?view=graph-rest-1.0) a [reminder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/reminder?view=graph-rest-1.0) for *user* calendars only.

| bodyPreview | String | The preview of the message associated with the event. It's in text format. |
| cancelledOccurrences | String collection | Contains **occurrenceId** property values of canceled instances in a recurring series, if the event is the series master. Instances in a recurring series that are canceled are called canceled occurences.  <br>  <br>Requires `$select` to retrieve. Only returned in a [Get](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/event-get?view=graph-rest-1.0) operation that specifies the ID \(**seriesMasterId** property value\) of a series master event. |

| hideAttendees | Boolean | When set to `true`, each attendee only sees themselves in the meeting request and meeting **Tracking** list. The default is false. |
| iCalUId | String | A unique identifier for an event across calendars. This ID is different for each occurrence in a recurring series. Read-only. |
| id | String | Unique identifier for the event. By default, this value changes when the item is moved from one container \(such as a folder or calendar\) to another. To change this behavior, use the `Prefer: IdType="ImmutableId"` header. See [Get immutable identifiers for Outlook resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/outlook-immutable-id) for more information. Case-sensitive and read-only. |
| importance | String | The importance of the event. The possible values are: `low`, `normal`, `high`. |
| isAllDay | Boolean | Set to true if the event lasts all day. If true, regardless of whether it's a single-day or multi-day event, start, and endtime must be set to midnight and be in the same time zone. |
| isCancelled | Boolean | Set to true if the event has been canceled. |

If you update the **location** property, any prior locations in the **locations** collection are removed and replaced by the new **location** value. |
| onlineMeeting | [OnlineMeetingInfo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/onlinemeetinginfo?view=graph-rest-1.0) | Details for an attendee to join the meeting online. The default is null. Read-only.  <br>After you set the **isOnlineMeeting** and **onlineMeetingProvider** properties to enable a meeting online, Microsoft Graph initializes **onlineMeeting**. When set, the meeting remains available online, and you can't change the **isOnlineMeeting**, **onlineMeetingProvider**, and **onlneMeeting** properties again. |
| onlineMeetingProvider | onlineMeetingProviderType | Represents the online meeting service provider. By default, **onlineMeetingProvider** is `unknown`. The possible values are `unknown`, `teamsForBusiness`, `skypeForBusiness`, and `skypeForConsumer`. Optional.  <br>After you set **onlineMeetingProvider**, Microsoft Graph initializes **onlineMeeting**. Subsequently, you can't change **onlineMeetingProvider** again, and the meeting remains available online. |
| onlineMeetingUrl | String | A URL for an online meeting. The property is set only when an organizer specifies in Outlook that an event is an online meeting such as Skype. Read-only.  <br>To access the URL to join an online meeting, use **joinUrl** which is exposed via the **onlineMeeting** property of the **event**. The **onlineMeetingUrl** property will be deprecated in the future. |
| organizer | [Recipient](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/recipient?view=graph-rest-1.0) | The organizer of the event. |
| originalEndTimeZone | String | The end time zone that was set when the event was created. A value of `tzone://Microsoft/Custom` indicates that a legacy custom time zone was set in desktop Outlook. |
| originalStart | DateTimeOffset | Represents the start time of an event when it's initially created as an occurrence or exception in a recurring series. This property is not returned for events that are single instances. Its date and time information is expressed in ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z` |
| originalStartTimeZone | String | The start time zone that was set when the event was created. A value of `tzone://Microsoft/Custom` indicates that a legacy custom time zone was set in desktop Outlook. |
| recurrence | [PatternedRecurrence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/patternedrecurrence?view=graph-rest-1.0) | The recurrence pattern for the event. |
| reminderMinutesBeforeStart | Int32 | The number of minutes before the event start time that the reminder alert occurs. |
| responseRequested | Boolean | Default is true, which represents the organizer would like an invitee to send a response to the event. |
| responseStatus | [ResponseStatus](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/responsestatus?view=graph-rest-1.0) | Indicates the type of response sent in response to an event message. |

| showAs | String | The status to show. The possible values are: `free`, `tentative`, `busy`, `oof`, `workingElsewhere`, `unknown`. |
| start | [DateTimeTimeZone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/datetimetimezone?view=graph-rest-1.0) | The start date, time, and time zone of the event. By default, the start time is in UTC. |
| subject | String | The text of the event's subject line. |
| transactionId | String | A custom identifier specified by a client app for the server to avoid redundant [POST](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/calendar-post-events?view=graph-rest-1.0) operations in case of client retries to create the same event. It's useful when low network connectivity causes the client to time out before receiving a response from the server for the client's prior create-event request. After you set **transactionId** when creating an event, you can't change **transactionId** in a subsequent update. This property is only returned in a response payload if an app has set it. Optional. |
| type | String | The event type. The possible values are: `singleInstance`, `occurrence`, `exception`, `seriesMaster`. Read-only |
| webLink | String | The URL to open the event in Outlook on the web.  <br>  <br>Outlook on the web opens the event in the browser if you are signed in to your mailbox. Otherwise, Outlook on the web prompts you to sign in.  <br>  <br>This URL can't be accessed from within an iFrame. |

Note

The **webLink** property specifies a URL that opens the event in only earlier versions of Outlook on the web. The following is its URL format, with *{event-id}* being the ***URL-encoded*** value of the **id** property:

- For work or school accounts: `https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?itemid={event-id}&exvsurl=1&path=/calendar/item`
- For Microsoft accounts: `https://outlook.live.com/owa/?itemid={event-id}&exvsurl=1&path=/calendar/item`

To open the event in a current version of Outlook on the web, convert the URL to one of the following formats, and use that URL to open the event:

- For work or school accounts: `https://outlook.office365.com/calendar/item/{event-id}`
- For Microsoft accounts: `https://outlook.live.com/calendar/item/{event-id}`
