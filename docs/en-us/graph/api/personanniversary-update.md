# Update personAnniversary

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update the properties of a [personAnniversary](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/personanniversary?view=graph-rest-beta) object in a user's [profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/profile?view=graph-rest-beta).

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | User.ReadWrite | AgentIdUser.ReadWrite.All, AgentIdUser.ReadWrite.IdentityParentedBy, User.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | User.ReadWrite | Not available. |
| Application | Not supported. | Not supported. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that aren't included in the request body maintain their previous values or are recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance, don't include existing values that haven't changed.

The following table shows the properties that are possible to update within an existing [personAnniversary](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/personanniversary?view=graph-rest-beta) object in a user's [profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/profile?view=graph-rest-beta).

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| allowedAudiences | String | The audiences that are able to see the values contained within the entity.

The possible values are: `me`, `family`, `contacts`, `groupMembers`, `organization`, `federatedOrganizations`, `everyone`, `unknownFutureValue`. |
| date | Date | Contains the date associated with the anniversary type. |
| inference | [inferenceData](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/inferencedata?view=graph-rest-beta) | Contains inference detail if the entity is inferred by the creating or modifying application. Inherited from [itemFacet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/itemfacet?view=graph-rest-beta). |
