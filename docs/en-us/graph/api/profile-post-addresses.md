# Create addresses

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Create a new [itemAddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/itemaddress?view=graph-rest-beta) object in a user's [profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/profile?view=graph-rest-beta).

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | User.ReadWrite | AgentIdUser.ReadWrite.All, AgentIdUser.ReadWrite.IdentityParentedBy, User.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | User.ReadWrite | Not available. |
| Application | Not supported. | Not supported. |

## HTTP request

POST /me/profile/addresses
POST /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/profile/addresses
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [itemAddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/itemaddress?view=graph-rest-beta) object.

The following table shows the properties that are possible to set when creating a new [itemAddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/itemaddress?view=graph-rest-beta) object in a user's [profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/profile?view=graph-rest-beta).

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| allowedAudiences | String | The audiences that are able to see the values contained within the entity. Inherited from [itemFacet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/itemfacet?view=graph-rest-beta). The possible values are: `me`, `family`, `contacts`, `groupMembers`, `organization`, `federatedOrganizations`, `everyone`, `unknownFutureValue`. |
| detail | [physicalAddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/physicaladdress?view=graph-rest-beta) | Details about the address itself. |
| displayName | String | Friendly name the user has assigned to this address. |
| geoCoordinates | [geoCoordinates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/geocoordinates?view=graph-rest-beta) | The geocoordinates of the address. |
| inference | [inferenceData](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/inferencedata?view=graph-rest-beta) | Contains inference detail if the entity is inferred by the creating or modifying application. Inherited from [itemFacet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/itemfacet?view=graph-rest-beta). |
| source | [personDataSource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/persondatasource?view=graph-rest-beta) | Where the values originated if synced from another service. Inherited from [itemFacet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/itemfacet?view=graph-rest-beta). |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [itemAddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/itemaddress?view=graph-rest-beta) object in the response body.
