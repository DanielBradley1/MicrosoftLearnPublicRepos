# Create custodians

Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

Create a new [ediscoveryCustodian](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-ediscoverycustodian?view=graph-rest-1.0) object. After the custodian object is created, you will need to create the custodian's [userSource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-usersource?view=graph-rest-1.0) to reference their mailbox and OneDrive for Business site.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | eDiscovery.Read.All | eDiscovery.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | eDiscovery.Read.All | eDiscovery.ReadWrite.All |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Purview role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/edisc-permissions) through one of the following options:

- **eDiscovery Manager**. Allows members to manage custodians and data sources for eDiscovery cases they create. However, eDiscovery Managers can only manage custodians for the cases they create. **This is the least privileged option for managing custodians in their own cases**.
- **eDiscovery Administrator**. Provides all the permissions of eDiscovery Manager, plus the ability to manage custodians and data sources for all eDiscovery cases in the organization.

The Custodian role provides access to manage data sources \(mailboxes, SharePoint sites, and Teams\) associated with custodians in eDiscovery cases. This role is only available to members of the eDiscovery Manager role group.

For more information about eDiscovery permissions and roles, see [Assign permissions in eDiscovery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/edisc-permissions).

## HTTP request

```http
POST /security/cases/ediscoveryCases/{ediscoveryCaseId}/custodians
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [microsoft.graph.security.ediscoveryCustodian](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-ediscoverycustodian?view=graph-rest-1.0) object in the response body.
