# Update relation

Namespace: microsoft.graph.security.caseManagement

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update the properties of a concrete [relation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-casemanagement-relation?view=graph-rest-beta) object.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | CaseManagement.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | CaseManagement.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. This API supports the following built-in roles:

- Global Reader
- Security Reader
- Security Operator
- Security Administrator

## HTTP request

```http
PATCH /security/caseManagement/cases/{caseId}/relations/{relationId}
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| Content-Type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply *only* the values for properties to update. Existing properties that aren't included in the request body maintain their previous values or are recalculated based on changes to other property values.

The following table specifies the properties that can be updated.

Supply a JSON representation of the resource. Include `@odata.type` in every request body to identify the concrete relation type. The value must match the existing relation type.

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| @odata.type | String | The OData type of the concrete relation. The supported values are `#microsoft.graph.security.caseManagement.incidentRelation`, `#microsoft.graph.security.caseManagement.recommendationRelation`, and `#microsoft.graph.security.caseManagement.workspaceIndicatorRelation`. Required. |
| relatedResourceId | String | The identifier of the related external resource. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code.
