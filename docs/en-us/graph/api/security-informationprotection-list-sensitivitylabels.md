# List sensitivityLabels

Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get a list of [sensitivityLabel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-sensitivitylabel?view=graph-rest-beta) objects associated with a user or organization.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | InformationProtectionPolicy.Read | Not available. |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | InformationProtectionPolicy.Read.All | Not available. |

## HTTP request

To get labels available to the signed-in user \(delegated permission\) or a specified user \(application permission\):

```http
GET /users/{usersId}/security/informationProtection/sensitivityLabels
GET /me/security/informationProtection/sensitivityLabels
```

To get labels available to the organization as a service principal \(application permission\):

```http
GET /security/informationProtection/sensitivityLabels
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports some of the OData query parameters to help customize the response. For general information, see [OData query parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters).

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| User-Agent | Describes the name and version of the calling application. Details will surface in Azure Information Protection Analytics. Suggested format is `ApplicationName/Version`. Optional. |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [sensitivityLabel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-sensitivitylabel?view=graph-rest-beta) objects in the response body.

Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version.
