## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | Application.Read.All | Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Application.Read.All | Application.ReadWrite.All, Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

Important

- A principal who creates an agent identity blueprint or blueprint principal is automatically assigned as the owner.
- Owners can create and modify agent identities associated with a blueprint they own without being assigned an Agent ID role.
- For nonowners to call this API in delegated scenarios using work or school accounts, the admin must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference). This operation supports the following least-privileged built-in role:

  - [Agent ID Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#agent-id-administrator)
