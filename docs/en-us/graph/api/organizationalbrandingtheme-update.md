# Update organizationalBrandingTheme

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update the properties of an [organizationalBrandingTheme](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/organizationalbrandingtheme?view=graph-rest-beta) object.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | OrganizationalBranding.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | OrganizationalBranding.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. *Organizational Branding Administrator* is the least privileged role supported for this operation.

## HTTP request

```http
PATCH /organization/{organizationId}/branding/themes/{organizationalBrandingThemeId}
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| Content-Type | application/json. Required. |
| Accept-Language | A valid ISO 639-1 locale or `0` for the default locale. Optional. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply *only* the values for properties to update. Existing properties that aren't included in the request body maintain their previous values or are recalculated based on changes to other property values.

The following table specifies the properties that can be updated.

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| name | String | The name of the branding theme. Required. |
| isDefaultTheme | Boolean | Indicates whether the theme is set as the default branding theme for the entire tenant and includes all applications within the tenant. When set to `true`, this theme is automatically applied to any application that doesn't have a specific theme assigned. This property is useful for enforcing consistent branding across multiple apps without configuring each one individually. Optional. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an updated [organizationalBrandingTheme](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/organizationalbrandingtheme?view=graph-rest-beta) object in the response body.
