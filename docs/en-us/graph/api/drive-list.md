## Remarks

Most users will only have a single Drive resource.

Groups and Sites may have multiple Drive resources available.

Drives with the [system](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/systemfacet?view=graph-rest-1.0) facet are hidden by default. To list them, include `system` in your `$select` statement.
