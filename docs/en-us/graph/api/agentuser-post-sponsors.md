# Add sponsors \(for agentUser\)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Assign an [agentUser](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/agentuser?view=graph-rest-1.0) a sponsor. Sponsors are users and groups that are responsible for this agent user's privileges in the tenant and for keeping the agent user's information and access up to date.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | User.ReadWrite.All | AgentIdUser.ReadWrite.All, AgentIdUser.ReadWrite.IdentityParentedBy, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | User.ReadWrite.All | AgentIdUser.ReadWrite.All, AgentIdUser.ReadWrite.IdentityParentedBy, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with the `microsoft.directory/users/sponsors/update` role permission. The following least privileged roles are supported for this operation:

- Directory Writers
- User Administrator
- Agent ID Administrator - For agent users
