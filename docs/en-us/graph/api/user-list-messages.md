# List messages

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get the messages in the signed-in user's mailbox \(including the Deleted Items and Clutter folders\).

Depending on the page size and mailbox data, getting messages from a mailbox can incur multiple requests. The default page size is 10 messages. Use `$top` to customize the page size, within the range of 1 and 1000.

To improve the operation response time, use `$select` to specify the exact properties you need; see [example 1](#example-1-list-all-messages) below. Fine-tune the values for `$select` and `$top`, especially when you must use a larger page size, as returning a page with hundreds of messages each with a full response payload may trigger the [gateway timeout](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/errors#http-status-codes) \(HTTP 504\).

To get the next page of messages, simply apply the entire URL returned in `@odata.nextLink` to the next get-messages request. This URL includes any query parameters you may have specified in the initial request.

Don't try to extract the `$skip` value from the `@odata.nextLink` URL to manipulate responses. This API uses the `$skip` value to keep count of all the items it has gone through in the user's mailbox to return a page of message-type items. It's therefore possible that even in the initial response, the `$skip` value is larger than the page size. For more information, see [Paging Microsoft Graph data in your app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/paging).

Currently, this operation returns message bodies in only HTML format.

There are two scenarios where an app can get messages in another user's mail folder:

- If the app has application permissions, or,
- If the app has the appropriate delegated [permissions](#permissions) from one user, and another user has shared a mail folder with that user, or, has given delegated access to that user. See [details and an example](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/outlook-share-messages-folders).

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | Mail.ReadBasic | Mail.ReadWrite, Mail.Read |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Mail.ReadBasic | Mail.ReadWrite, Mail.Read |
| Application | Mail.ReadBasic.All | Mail.ReadWrite, Mail.Read |

## HTTP request

To get all the messages in a user's mailbox:

```http
GET /me/messages
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/messages
```

To get messages in a specific folder in the user's mailbox:

```http
GET /me/mailFolders/{id}/messages
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/{id}/messages
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

### Using filter and orderby in the same query

When using `$filter` and `$orderby` in the same query to get messages, make sure to specify properties in the following ways:

1. Properties that appear in `$orderby` must also appear in `$filter`.
2. Properties that appear in `$orderby` are in the same order as in `$filter`.
3. Properties that are present in `$orderby` appear in `$filter` before any properties that aren't.

Failing to do this results in the following error:

- Error code: `InefficientFilter`
- Error message: `The restriction or sort order is too complex for this operation.`

## Request headers

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | string | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| Prefer: outlook.body-content-type | string | The format of the **body** and **uniqueBody** properties to be returned in. Values can be "text" or "html". If the header is not specified, the **body** and **uniqueBody** properties are returned in HTML format. Optional. |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [Message](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/message?view=graph-rest-1.0) objects in the response body.

## Examples

### Example 1: List all messages

#### Request

The following shows an example that gets the default, top 10 messages in the signed-in user's mailbox. It uses `$select` to return a subset of the properties of each message in the response.
