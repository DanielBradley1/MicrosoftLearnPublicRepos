# Get agentInstance

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Important

**Upcoming change to Agent Registry APIs**

Starting May 2026, the Agent Registry APIs in Microsoft Graph will be replaced by the [Agent Registry APIs powered by Microsoft Agent 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-agent-365/admin/graph-api). This change consolidates agent management experiences to make it easier to observe, govern, and secure all agents in your tenant. We recommend that you plan to migrate to the new Agent 365-based APIs when they are released. Learn more about [Agent Registry convergence with Microsoft Agent 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/agent-id/agent-registry-convergence).

Read the properties and relationships of [agentInstance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/agentinstance?view=graph-rest-beta) object.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | AgentInstance.Read.All | AgentInstance.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | AgentInstance.Read.All | AgentInstance.ReadWrite.All, AgentInstance.ReadWrite.ManagedBy |

Important

When using delegated permissions, the authenticated user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation.

*Agent Registry Administrator* is the least privileged role supported for this operation.
