# Get educationAssignmentResource

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get the properties of an [education assignment resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationassignmentresource?view=graph-rest-1.0) associated with an [assignment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/educationassignment?view=graph-rest-1.0). Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types).
