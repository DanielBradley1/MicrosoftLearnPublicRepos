# Get teamworkSection

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Read the properties of a [section](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/teamworksection?view=graph-rest-beta) in a user's [teamwork](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/userteamwork?view=graph-rest-beta).

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | TeamworkSection.Read | TeamworkSection.ReadWrite |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | TeamworkSection.Read.All | TeamworkSection.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

```http
GET /users/{user-id}/teamwork/sections/{teamworkSection-id}
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$expand` OData query parameter to help customize the response. Only the **items** relationship can be expanded, and only one level of expansion is supported. For more information, see [OData query parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters).

When `$expand=items` is specified, the response includes the **items** collection inline on the section:

- For a [user-defined section](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/teamworksection?view=graph-rest-beta#sectiontype-values), the **items** collection contains the chats, channels, meetings, and communities organized within the section.
- For a [system-defined section](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/teamworksection?view=graph-rest-beta#system-defined-sections), the **items** collection is always returned as an empty array \(`[]`\). System-defined section contents aren't exposed through the public Graph API.

## Request headers

| Header | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| If-None-Match | The value of the **@microsoft.graph.sectionsVersion** annotation returned when you [list sections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/userteamwork-list-sections?view=graph-rest-beta), or the **@odata.etag** value from any previously retrieved [section](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/teamworksection?view=graph-rest-beta). If the section hierarchy didn't change, this header returns a `304 Not Modified` response code. Optional. |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [teamworkSection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/teamworksection?view=graph-rest-beta) object in the response body. If the `If-None-Match` header is provided and the resource didn't change, this method returns a `304 Not Modified` response.
