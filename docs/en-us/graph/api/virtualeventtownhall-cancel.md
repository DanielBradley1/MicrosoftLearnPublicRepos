# virtualEventTownhall: cancel

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Cancel a [virtualEventTownhall](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/virtualeventtownhall?view=graph-rest-1.0). A canceled town hall has its **status** set to `canceled` permanently. You can still get a canceled town hall by using the [Get virtualEventTownhall](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/virtualeventtownhall-get?view=graph-rest-1.0) API.

Only the **Organizer** can cancel a townhall event.
