# Delete passwordlessMicrosoftAuthenticatorAuthenticationMethod \(deprecated\)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Deletes a user's [Microsoft Authenticator Passwordless Phone Sign-in method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/passwordlessmicrosoftauthenticatorauthenticationmethod?view=graph-rest-beta) object.

Caution

The Microsoft Authenticator Passwordless Phone Sign-in method API is deprecated and will stop returning results on December 31, 2020. Please use the new [Microsoft Authenticator Authentication Method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/microsoftauthenticatorauthenticationmethod?view=graph-rest-beta).

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

The following tables show the least privileged permission or permissions required to call this API on each supported resource type. Follow [best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions) to request least privileged permissions. For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

### Permissions acting on self

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite | UserAuthMethod-MicrosoftAuthApp.ReadWrite, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All, UserAuthMethod-MicrosoftAuthApp.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |

### Permissions acting on other users

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite | UserAuthMethod-MicrosoftAuthApp.ReadWrite, UserAuthMethod-MicrosoftAuthApp.ReadWrite.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All | UserAuthMethod-MicrosoftAuthApp.ReadWrite.All |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts where the signed-in user is acting on another user, they must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. This operation supports the following built-in roles, which provide only the least privilege necessary:

- Authentication Administrator
- Privileged Authentication Administrator

When users manage their own authentication methods, the system prompts them to complete multi-factor authentication \(MFA\) if they last authenticated more than 10 minutes ago in the current session.

## HTTP request

Remove a Microsoft Authenticator Passwordless Phone Sign-in authentication method from your own account. For a signed-in user to update their own authentication method, they must have satisfied a multi-factor authentication requirement during sign in.

```http
DELETE /me/authentication/passwordlessMicrosoftAuthenticatorMethods/{id}
```

Note

Calling the `/me` endpoint requires a signed-in user and therefore a delegated permission. Application permissions aren't supported when using the `/me` endpoint.

Remove a Microsoft Authenticator Passwordless Phone Sign-in authentication method from another user's account.

```http
DELETE /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/authentication/passwordlessMicrosoftAuthenticatorMethods/{id}
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code. It doesn't return anything in the response body.
