# List detectionRule objects

Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get a list of [detectionRule](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-detectionrule?view=graph-rest-beta) objects and their properties.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | CustomDetection.Read.All | CustomDetection.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | CustomDetection.Read.All | CustomDetection.ReadWrite.All |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a role that grants the permissions required for this operation. Custom detection rules use the Microsoft Defender XDR Unified role-based access control \(RBAC\) model. The following [Microsoft Entra roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) are supported:

- **Security Reader**
- **Global Reader**
- **Security Operator**
- **Security Administrator**

Additional workload-specific read permissions might be required to view rules that target data from specific Defender workloads \(for example, Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Office 365\). For more information, see [Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/manage-rbac).

## HTTP request

```http
GET /security/rules/detectionRules
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select`, `$top`, `$skip`, `$count`, `$filter`, and `$orderby` [OData query parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. For the per-property list of supported `$filter` operators and `$orderby` properties, see [detectionRule properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-detectionrule?view=graph-rest-beta#properties).

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [microsoft.graph.security.detectionRule](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-detectionrule?view=graph-rest-beta) objects in the response body.

Important

Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/use-beta).

For details about how to [add the SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).

```go


// Code snippets are only available for the latest major version. Current major version is $v0.*

// Dependencies
import (
	  "context"
	  msgraphsdk "github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-beta-sdk-go"
