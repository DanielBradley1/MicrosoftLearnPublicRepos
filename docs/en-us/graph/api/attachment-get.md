# Get attachment

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Read the properties, relationships, or raw contents of an attachment that is attached to a user [event](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/event?view=graph-rest-1.0), [message](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/message?view=graph-rest-1.0), or group [post](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/post?view=graph-rest-1.0).

An attachment can be one of the following types:

- A file. Programmatically, this is a [fileAttachment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/fileattachment?view=graph-rest-1.0) resource. See [example 1](#example-1-get-the-properties-of-a-file-attachment).
- An Outlook item \(contact, event or message\). Programmatically, an item attachment is an [itemAttachment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/itemattachment?view=graph-rest-1.0) resource. You can use `$expand` to further get the properties of that item, including any nested attachments up to 30 levels. See [example 3](#example-3-expand-and-get-the-properties-of-the-item-attached-to-a-message) and [example 4](#example-4-expand-and-get-the-properties-of-an-item-attached-to-a-message-including-any-attachment-to-the-item).
- A link to a file stored in the cloud. Programmatically, this is a [referenceAttachment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/referenceattachment?view=graph-rest-1.0) resource. See [example 5](#example-5-get-the-properties-of-a-reference-attachment).

All these types of attachments are derived from the [attachment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/attachment?view=graph-rest-1.0) resource.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### Get the raw contents of a file or item attachment

You can append the path segment `/$value` to get the raw contents of a file or item attachment.

For a file attachment, the content type is based on its original content type. See [example 6](#example-6-get-the-raw-contents-of-a-file-attachment-on-a-message).

For an item attachment that is a [contact](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/contact?view=graph-rest-1.0), [event](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/event?view=graph-rest-1.0), or [message](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/message?view=graph-rest-1.0), the raw contents returned is in MIME format.

| Item attachment type | Raw contents returned |
| :--- | :--- |
| **contact** | [vCard](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2426.html) MIME format. See [example](#example-7-get-the-mime-raw-contents-of-a-contact-attachment-on-a-message). |
| **event** | iCal MIME format. See [example](#example-8-get-the-mime-raw-contents-of-an-event-attachment-on-a-message). |
| **message** | MIME format. See [example](#example-9-get-the-mime-raw-contents-of-a-meeting-invitation-item-attachment-on-a-message). |

Attempting to get the `$value` of a reference attachment returns HTTP 405.

Note

When certain files are requested, MIME can encode the byte stream output in the response and provide a link to download the file as an email attachment.

## Permissions

Depending on the resource \(**event**, **message**, or **post**\) that the attachment is attached to and the permission type \(delegated or application\) requested, the permission specified in the following table is the least privileged required to call this API. To learn more, including [taking caution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts#best-practices-for-requesting-permissions) before choosing more privileged permissions, search for the following permissions in [Permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Supported resource | Delegated \(work or school account\) | Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [event](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/event?view=graph-rest-1.0) | Calendars.Read | Calendars.Read | Calendars.Read |
| [message](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/message?view=graph-rest-1.0) | Mail.Read | Mail.Read | Mail.Read |
| [post](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/post?view=graph-rest-1.0) | Group.Read.All | Not supported | Not supported |

## HTTP request

This section shows the HTTP GET request syntax for each of the entities \([event](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/event?view=graph-rest-1.0), [message](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/message?view=graph-rest-1.0), and [post](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/post?view=graph-rest-1.0)\) that support attachments:

- To get the properties and relationships of an attachment, specify the attachment ID to index into the **attachments** collection, attached to the specified [event](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/event?view=graph-rest-1.0), [message](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/message?view=graph-rest-1.0), or [post](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/post?view=graph-rest-1.0) instance.
- If the attachment is a file or Outlook item \(contact, event, or message\), you can further get the raw contents of the attachment by appending the path segment `/$value` to the request URL.

### Example 4: Expand and get the properties of an item attached to a message, including any attachment to the item

#### Request

The next example uses the same request as in [example 3](#example-3-expand-and-get-the-properties-of-the-item-attached-to-a-message) to get the properties of an item attachment on a message by using `$expand`. In this case, because the attached item also has a file attachment, the response includes the properties of the file attachment as well.
