# accessPackage: filterByCurrentUser

Namespace: microsoft.graph

In [Microsoft Entra Entitlement Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/entitlementmanagement-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0), retrieve a list of [accessPackage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/accesspackage?view=graph-rest-1.0) objects filtered on the signed-in user.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | EntitlementMgmt-SubjectAccess.ReadWrite | EntitlementManagement.Read.All, EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Not supported. | Not supported. |

## HTTP request

```http

The following table shows the parameters that can be used with this function.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| on | accessPackageFilterByCurrentUserOptions | The list of user options that can be used to filter on the access packages list. The allowed value is `allowedRequestor`. |

- `allowedRequestor` is used to get the `accessPackage` objects for which the signed-in user is allowed to submit access requests. The resulting list includes all access packages that can be requested by the caller across all catalogs.

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
