# Update customAppScope

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Update an existing [customAppScope](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/customappscope?view=graph-rest-beta) object of an RBAC provider.

Currently only the Exchange Online RBAC provider is supported.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Exchange | Not available. |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Exchange | Not available. |

## HTTP request

For an Exchange Online provider:

```http
PATCH /roleManagement/exchange/customAppScopes/{id}
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| Content-Type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that aren't included in the request body maintain their previous values or are recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance, don't include existing values that haven't changed.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code. It doesn't return anything in the response body.

## Examples
