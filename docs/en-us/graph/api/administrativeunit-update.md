# Update administrativeUnit

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Update the properties of an [administrativeUnit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/administrativeunit?view=graph-rest-1.0) object.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be a member user or be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. *Privileged Role Administrator* is the least privileged role supported for this operation.

## HTTP request

```http
PATCH /directory/administrativeUnits/{id}
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply *only* the values for properties to update. Existing properties that aren't included in the request body maintain their previous values or are recalculated based on changes to other property values.

The following table specifies the properties that can be updated.

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| description | String | Description for the administrative unit. |
| displayName | String | Display name for the administrative unit. |
| membershipRule | String | The dynamic membership rule for the administrative unit. For more information about the rules you can use for dynamic administrative units and dynamic groups, see [Manage rules for dynamic membership groups in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/users/groups-dynamic-membership). |
| membershipRuleProcessingState | String | Controls whether the dynamic membership rule is actively processed. Set to `On` to activate the dynamic membership rule, or `Paused` to stop updating membership dynamically. |
| membershipType | String | Indicates the membership type for the administrative unit. The possible values are: `dynamic`, `assigned`. If not set, the default value is `null` and the default behavior is assigned. |
| visibility | String | The visibility of the administrative unit. If not set, the default value is `null` and the default behavior is public. It can be set to `HiddenMembership` to hide the membership from nonmembers. |

The **administrativeUnit** resource supports [extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/extensibility-overview), which allows you to use the `PATCH` operation to add, update, or delete your own app-specific data in custom properties of an extension in an existing **administrativeUnit** instance.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code.

## Example

### Request

The following example shows a request that sets a dynamic membership rule on an existing administrative unit to include all users whose country is the United States. It also updates the display name of the administrative unit.
