# Create iosWiredNetworkConfiguration

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> **Important:** Microsoft supports Intune /beta APIs, but they are subject to more frequent change. Microsoft recommends using version v1.0 when possible. Check an API's availability in version v1.0 using the Version selector.

> **Note:** The Microsoft Graph API for Intune requires an [active Intune license](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) for the tenant.

Create a new [iosWiredNetworkConfiguration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-deviceconfig-ioswirednetworkconfiguration?view=graph-rest-beta) object.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

POST /deviceManagement/deviceConfigurations
POST /deviceManagement/deviceConfigurations/{deviceConfigurationId}/microsoft.graph.windowsDomainJoinConfiguration/networkAccessConfigurations
```

## Request headers

| Header | Value |
| :--- | :--- |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation for the iosWiredNetworkConfiguration object.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the iosWiredNetworkConfiguration.

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id | String | Key of the entity. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration?view=graph-rest-beta) |

| supportsScopeTags | Boolean | Indicates whether or not the underlying Device Configuration supports the assignment of scope tags. Assigning to the ScopeTags property is not allowed when this value is false and entities will not be visible to scoped users. This occurs for Legacy policies created in Silverlight and can be resolved by deleting and recreating the policy in the Azure Portal. This property is read-only. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-shared-deviceconfiguration?view=graph-rest-beta) |

| eapFastConfiguration | [eapFastConfiguration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-deviceconfig-eapfastconfiguration?view=graph-rest-beta) | EAP-FAST Configuration Option when EAP-FAST is the selected EAP Type. Possible values are: `noProtectedAccessCredential`, `useProtectedAccessCredential`, `useProtectedAccessCredentialAndProvision`, `useProtectedAccessCredentialAndProvisionAnonymously`. |
| trustedServerCertificateNames | String collection | Trusted server certificate names when EAP Type is configured to EAP-TLS/TTLS or PEAP.

Possible values are: `unencryptedPassword`, `challengeHandshakeAuthenticationProtocol`, `microsoftChap`, `microsoftChapVersionTwo`. |
| outerIdentityPrivacyMaskValue | String | Enable identity privacy \(Outer Identity\) when EAP Type is configured to EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS or PEAP. This property masks usernames with the text you enter. For example, if you use 'anonymous', each user that authenticates with this wired network using their real username is displayed as 'anonymous'. |

## Response
