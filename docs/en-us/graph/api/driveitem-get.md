# Get driveItem

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve the metadata for a [driveItem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/driveitem?view=graph-rest-1.0) in a [drive](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/drive?view=graph-rest-1.0) by file system path or ID. `item-id` is the ID of a drive item. It can also be the unique ID of a [SharePoint list item](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/listitem?view=graph-rest-1.0).

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | Files.Read | Files.ReadWrite, Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, Group.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Files.Read | Files.ReadWrite, Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All |
| Application | Files.Read.All | Files.ReadWrite.All, Group.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

Note

SharePoint Embedded requires the `FileStorageContainer.Selected` permission to access the content of the container. This permission is different from the ones mentioned previously. In addition to Microsoft Graph permissions, your app must have the necessary [container type permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/embedded/development/auth#container-type-application-permissions) to call this API. For more information, see [SharePoint Embedded authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/app-concepts/auth).

## HTTP request

```http
GET /drives/{drive-id}/items/{item-id}
GET /drives/{drive-id}/root:/{item-path}
GET /groups/{group-id}/drive/items/{item-id}
GET /groups/{group-id}/drive/root:/{item-path}
GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}
GET /me/drive/root:/{item-path}
GET /sites/{site-id}/drive/items/{item-id}
GET /sites/{site-id}/drive/root:/{item-path}
GET /sites/{site-id}/lists/{list-id}/items/{item-id}/driveItem
GET /users/{user-id | userPrincipalName}/drive/items/{item-id}
GET /users/{user-id | userPrincipalName}/drive/root:/{item-path}
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$expand` and `$select` [OData query parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters) to customize the response.

You can use the [`$expand` query string parameter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters) to include the children of an item in the same call as retrieving the metadata of an item if the item has a **children** relationship.

You can also use the `includeDeletedItems=true` query parameter to return deleted items. This query parameter is only valid when targeting a [driveItem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/driveitem?view=graph-rest-1.0) by ID, and otherwise will be ignored. This is currently only supported on OneDrive Personal.

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| if-none-match | String. If this request header is included and the eTag \(or cTag\) provided matches the current tag on the file, an `HTTP 304 Not Modified` response is returned. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and the [driveItem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/driveitem?view=graph-rest-1.0) resource in the response body.
