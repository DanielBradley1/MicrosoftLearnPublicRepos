Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Caution

The eDiscovery APIs in the microsoft.graph.eDiscovery subnamespace are deprecated. Use the new [eDiscovery APIs under microsoft.graph.security subnamespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-api-overview#ediscovery).

Get a list of the [custodian](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/ediscovery-custodian?view=graph-rest-beta) objects and their properties.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).
