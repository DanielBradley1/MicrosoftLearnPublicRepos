# Planner: delta

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Retrieves changes to objects that the user is [subscribed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/planner-overview?view=graph-rest-beta#track-changes-using-delta-query) to.

This method allows your application to track changes to objects that the user can access from within Planner over time.

The return value of this method might contain heterogeneous types of objects from Planner.

For more information about tracking changes in Microsoft Graph data, see [Use delta query to track changes in Microsoft Graph data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/delta-query-overview).

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | Tasks.Read | Group.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Tasks.ReadWrite |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Not supported. | Not supported. |

## HTTP request

```http
GET /me/planner/all/delta
GET /users/{id}/planner/all/delta
```

No additional query parameters \(such as `$select`, `$expand`, or `$filter`\) are currently supported on Planner's implementation of delta queries.

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of changes to be applied to objects in the response body, and a Delta Sync link to follow.

If the `@odata.deltaLink` that the caller uses is malformed, this endpoint returns HTTP 400.

If the `@odata.deltaLink` that the caller uses is too old, this endpoint returns HTTP 410.

This method can return any of the [HTTP status codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/errors). The most common errors that apps should handle for this method are the 403 and 404 responses. For more information about these errors, see [Common Planner error conditions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/planner-overview?view=graph-rest-beta#common-planner-error-conditions).
