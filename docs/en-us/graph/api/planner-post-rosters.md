# Create plannerRoster

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Create a new [plannerRoster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/plannerroster?view=graph-rest-beta) object.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | Tasks.ReadWrite | Not available. |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Tasks.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |

## HTTP request

```http
POST /planner/rosters
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| Content-Type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [plannerRoster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/plannerroster?view=graph-rest-beta) object.

There are no writable properties on [plannerRoster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/plannerroster?view=graph-rest-beta).

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [plannerRoster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/plannerroster?view=graph-rest-beta) object in the response body.

This method fails with a `403 Forbidden` response code in the following situations. The **code** property in the error response indicates the specific error.

| Description | Code property value |
| :--- | :--- |
| If labels are mandatory for the user and the created roster has no sensitivity label, the request fails. | `sensitivityLabelsAreMandatory` |
| If the roster is created with guest members initially added, but the proposed sensitivity label disallows the addition of guests, the request fails. | `addingGuestUsersProhibitedByLabel` |
| If the provided label doesn't have the correct tenant ID, the request fails. | `tenantIdIsIncorrect` |
