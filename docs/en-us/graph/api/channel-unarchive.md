# channel: unarchive

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Restore an archived [channel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/channel?view=graph-rest-1.0). Unarchiving restores the ability for users to send messages and edit the channel. Channels are archived via the [channel: archive](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/channel-archive?view=graph-rest-1.0) method.

Unarchiving is an asynchronous operation; a channel is unarchived when the asynchronous unarchiving operation completes successfully, which might occur after this method responds.

> **Note**: An archived channel that belongs to an archived team can't be unarchived. Unarchive the team before you unarchive the channel; otherwise, the request fails.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |

> **Note**: This API supports admin permissions. Users with the Global Administrator or Microsoft Teams service admin roles can access teams that they aren't a member of.

## HTTP request

```http
POST /teams/{team-id}/channels/{channel-id}/unarchive
POST /groups/{team-id}/team/channels/{channel-id}/unarchive
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If unarchiving is started successfully, this method returns a `202 Accepted` response code. The response contains a `Location` header that specifies the location of the [teamsAsyncOperation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/teamsasyncoperation?view=graph-rest-1.0) that was created to handle the unarchiving of the channel in a team. Check the status of the unarchiving operation by making a GET request to this location.
