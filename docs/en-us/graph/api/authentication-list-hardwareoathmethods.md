# List hardwareOathAuthenticationMethod objects

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get a list of the [hardware tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/hardwareoathauthenticationmethod?view=graph-rest-beta) assigned to a [user](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-beta).

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

### Permissions acting on self

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Not supported. | Not supported. |

### Permissions acting on other users

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts where the signed-in user is acting on another user, they must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. This operation supports the following built-in roles, which provide only the least privilege necessary:

- Global Reader
- Authentication Administrator
- Privileged Authentication Administrator

## HTTP request

Get details of your own hardware OATH methods.

```http
GET /me/authentication/hardwareOathMethods
```

Note

Calling the `/me` endpoint requires a signed-in user and therefore a delegated permission. Application permissions aren't supported when using the `/me` endpoint.

Get details of another user's hardware OATH methods.

```http
GET /users/{usersId}/authentication/hardwareOathMethods
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select`, `$filter` and `$top` OData query parameters to help customize the response. For general information, see [OData query parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters).

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [hardwareOathAuthenticationMethod](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/hardwareoathauthenticationmethod?view=graph-rest-beta) objects in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

The following example shows a request to retrieve the hardware tokens for the signed-in user.

Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version.
