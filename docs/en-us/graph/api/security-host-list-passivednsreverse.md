# List passiveDnsReverse

Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

Note

The Microsoft Graph API for Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence requires an [active Defender Threat Intelligence Portal license and API add-on license](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2235706) for the tenant.

Get a collection of [passiveDnsRecord](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-passivednsrecord?view=graph-rest-1.0) resources from a reverse passive DNS retrieval.

A reverse DNS lookup queries the hostname of a [host](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-host?view=graph-rest-1.0) using an IP address.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).
