# List createdObjects

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get a list of directory objects that were created by the user. This API returns only those directory objects that were created by a user who isn't in any administrator role; otherwise, it returns an empty object.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | User.Read | AgentIdUser.ReadWrite.All, AgentIdUser.ReadWrite.IdentityParentedBy, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite, User.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | User.Read | User.ReadWrite |
| Application | User.Read.All | AgentIdUser.ReadWrite.All, AgentIdUser.ReadWrite.IdentityParentedBy, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, User.ReadWrite.All |

Important

When an application queries a relationship that returns a **directoryObject** type collection, if it doesn't have permission to read a certain resource type, members of that type are returned but with limited information. For example, only the **@odata.type** property for the object type and the **id** is returned, while other properties are indicated as `null`. With this behavior, applications can request the least privileged permissions they need, rather than rely on the set of *Directory.*\* permissions. For details, see [Limited information returned for inaccessible member objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#limited-information-returned-for-inaccessible-member-objects).

## HTTP request

```http
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/createdObjects
GET /me/createdObjects
```

Note

Calling the `/me` endpoint requires a signed-in user and therefore a delegated permission. Application permissions aren't supported when using the `/me` endpoint.

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

## Request headers

| Header | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| Content-Type | application/json |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [directoryObject](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/directoryobject?view=graph-rest-1.0) objects in the response body.
