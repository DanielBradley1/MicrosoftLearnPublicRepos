# List domainNameReferences

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a list of [directoryObject](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/directoryobject?view=graph-rest-1.0) with a reference to the domain. The returned list will contain all directory objects that have a dependency on the domain.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | Domain.Read.All | Domain.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Domain.Read.All | Domain.ReadWrite.All |

Important

When an application queries a relationship that returns a **directoryObject** type collection, if it doesn't have permission to read a certain resource type, members of that type are returned but with limited information. For example, only the **@odata.type** property for the object type and the **id** is returned, while other properties are indicated as `null`. With this behavior, applications can request the least privileged permissions they need, rather than rely on the set of *Directory.*\* permissions. For details, see [Limited information returned for inaccessible member objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#limited-information-returned-for-inaccessible-member-objects).

Important

In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with a supported role permission. The following least privileged roles are supported for this operation: *Domain Name Administrator* or *Global Reader*.

## HTTP request

```http
GET /domains/{id}/domainNameReferences
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select` and `$filter` [OData Query Parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. You can only filter by the OData type of the objects returned, for example, `/domains/{domainId}/domainNameReferences/microsoft.graph.group` and `/domains/{domainId}/domainNameReferences/microsoft.graph.user`.

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [directoryObject](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/directoryobject?view=graph-rest-1.0) objects in the response body.
