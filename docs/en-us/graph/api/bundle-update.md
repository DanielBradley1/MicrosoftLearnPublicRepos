# Update bundle

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Update the metadata for a [bundle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/bundle?view=graph-rest-1.0) of [driveItems](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/driveitem?view=graph-rest-1.0) by ID. You can only update the following metadata:

- Bundle name
- Album `coverImageItemId` \(if applicable\)

Any other change requests will be ignored.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Files.ReadWrite | Files.ReadWrite.All |
| Application | Not supported. | Not supported. |

## HTTP request

```http
PATCH /drive/items/{bundle-id}
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| if-match | eTag. Optional. If this request header is included and the eTag provided doesn't match the current eTag on the bundle, a `412 Precondition Failed` response is returned. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance, don't include existing values that haven't changed.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a [driveItem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/driveitem?view=graph-rest-1.0) resource that represents the updated bundle in the response body.

For information about error responses, see [Error responses](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/errors).
