# Get application

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get the properties and relationships of an [application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0) object. This API can be used to get [agentIdentityBlueprint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/agentidentityblueprint?view=graph-rest-1.0) objects as well by their ID.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | Application.Read.All | Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Application.Read.All | Application.ReadWrite.All |
| Application | Application.Read.All | Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts where the signed-in user is acting on another user, they must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. This operation supports the following built-in roles, which provide only the least privilege necessary:

- A non-admin member or guest user with default user permissions
- Application Developer - read properties of application they own
- Directory Readers - read standard properties
- Global Secure Access Administrator - read standard properties
- Global Reader
- Directory Writers
- Hybrid Identity Administrator
- Security Administrator
- Cloud Application Administrator
- Application Administrator

## HTTP request

You can address the application using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application \(Client\) ID**, respectively, in app registrations in the Microsoft Entra admin center. Replace `{applicationObjectId}` with the **id** for the application object.

```http
GET /applications/{applicationObjectId}
GET /applications(appId='{appId}')
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select` [OData query parameter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters) to retrieve specific application properties.

By default, this API doesn't return the public key value of the **key** in the **keyCredential** property unless **keyCredentials** is specified in a `$select` query. For example, `$select=id,appId,keyCredentials`.

The use of `$select` to get **keyCredentials** for applications has a throttling limit of 150 requests per minute for every tenant.

The **managerApplications** property is not returned by default. To retrieve it, use `$select=managerApplications` or include it in a `$select` query with other properties. For example, `$select=id,appId,managerApplications`.

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an [application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0) or [agentIdentityBlueprint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/agentidentityblueprint?view=graph-rest-1.0) object in the response body.
