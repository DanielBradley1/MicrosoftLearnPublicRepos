# Remove resourceRoleScope from an accessPackage

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Remove an [accessPackageResourceRoleScope](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/accesspackageresourcerolescope?view=graph-rest-1.0) from an [accessPackage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/accesspackage?view=graph-rest-1.0) list of resource role scopes.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |

Tip

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned an administrator role with supported role permissions through one of the following options:

- A [role in the Entitlement Management system](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate) where the least privileged roles are:

  - *Access package manager*. **This is the least privileged option**
  - Catalog owner

- More privileged [Microsoft Entra roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) supported for this operation:

  - Identity Governance Administrator

In app-only scenarios, the calling app can be assigned one of the preceding supported roles instead of the `EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All` application permission. The *Access package manager* role is less privileged than the `EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All` application permission.

For more information, see [Delegation and roles in entitlement management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate) and [how to delegate access governance to access package managers in entitlement management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate-managers).
