# accessPackageAssignment: filterByCurrentUser

Namespace: microsoft.graph

In [Microsoft Entra Entitlement Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/entitlementmanagement-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0), retrieve a list of [accessPackageAssignment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/accesspackageassignment?view=graph-rest-1.0) objects filtered on the signed-in user.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | EntitlementMgmt-SubjectAccess.ReadWrite | EntitlementManagement.Read.All, EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Not supported. | Not supported. |

## HTTP request

```http
GET /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/assignments/filterByCurrentUser(on='parameterValue')
```

## Function parameters

The following table shows the parameters that can be used with this function.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| on | accessPackageAssignmentFilterByCurrentUserOptions | The list of user options that can be used to filter on the access package assignments list. The possible values are: `target`, `createdBy`. |

- `target` is used to get the `accessPackageAssignment` objects where the signed-in user is the target. The resulting list includes all of the assignments, current and expired, for the caller across all catalogs and access packages.
- `createdBy` is used to get the `accessPackageAssignment` objects created by the signed-in user. The resulting list includes all of the assignments that the caller created for themselves or on behalf of others, such as in case of admin direct assignment, across all catalogs and access packages.

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an [accessPackageAssignment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/accesspackageassignment?view=graph-rest-1.0) collection in the response body.

When a result set spans multiple pages, Microsoft Graph returns that page with an `@odata.nextLink` property in the response that contains a URL to the next page of results. If that property is present, continue making additional requests with the `@odata.nextLink` URL in each response, until all the results are returned. For more information, see [paging Microsoft Graph data in your app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/paging).
