# Get externalAuthenticationMethod

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Read the properties and relationships of an [externalAuthenticationMethod](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/externalauthenticationmethod?view=graph-rest-1.0) object.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

### Permissions acting on self

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite, UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Not supported. | Not supported. |

### Permissions acting on other users

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | UserAuthMethod-External.Read | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read, UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All, UserAuthMethod-External.Read.All, UserAuthMethod-External.ReadWrite, UserAuthMethod-External.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | UserAuthMethod-External.Read.All | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All, UserAuthMethod-External.ReadWrite.All |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts where the signed-in user is acting on another user, they must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. This operation supports the following built-in roles, which provide only the least privilege necessary:

- Global Reader
- Authentication Administrator
- Privileged Authentication Administrator

## HTTP request

To read details of your own external MFA:

Note

Calling the `/me` endpoint requires a signed-in user and therefore a delegated permission. Application permissions aren't supported when using the `/me` endpoint.

```http
GET /me/authentication/externalAuthenticationMethods/{externalAuthenticationMethodId}
```

To read details of your own or another user's external MFA:

Note

When calling the `/users/{id}` endpoint with `{id}` representing the signed-in user, the least privileged delegated permissions are *UserAuthenticationMethod.Read* for read operations and *UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite* for write operations.

```http
GET /users/{usersId}/authentication/externalAuthenticationMethods/{externalAuthenticationMethodId}
```

## Optional query parameters

Not supported.

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and an [externalAuthenticationMethod](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/externalauthenticationmethod?view=graph-rest-1.0) object in the response body.
