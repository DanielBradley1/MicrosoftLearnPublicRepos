# unifiedRoleAssignmentScheduleRequest: cancel

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Immediately cancel a [unifiedRoleAssignmentScheduleRequest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/unifiedroleassignmentschedulerequest?view=graph-rest-1.0) object that is in a `Granted` status, and have the system automatically delete the canceled request after 30 days. After calling this action, the **status** of the canceled **unifiedRoleAssignmentScheduleRequest** changes to `Canceled`.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | RoleAssignmentSchedule.ReadWrite.Directory | RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | RoleAssignmentSchedule.ReadWrite.Directory | RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. This operation supports the following built-in roles, which provide only the least privilege necessary:

- For read operations: *Global Reader*, *Security Operator*, *Security Reader*, *Security Administrator*, or *Privileged Role Administrator*
- For write operations: *Privileged Role Administrator*
