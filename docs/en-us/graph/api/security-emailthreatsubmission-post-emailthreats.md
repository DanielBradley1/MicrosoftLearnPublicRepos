# Create emailThreatSubmission

Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Create a new [emailThreatSubmission](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-emailthreatsubmission?view=graph-rest-beta) object.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | ThreatSubmission.ReadWrite | ThreatSubmission.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | ThreatSubmission.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |

## HTTP request

```http
POST /security/threatSubmission/emailThreats
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| Content-Type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of either an [emailContentThreatSubmission](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-emailcontentthreatsubmission?view=graph-rest-beta) object or an [emailUrlThreatSubmission](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-emailurlthreatsubmission?view=graph-rest-beta) object.

The **emailContentThreatSubmission** and **emailUrlThreatSubmission** resources are both subtypes of the **emailThreatSubmission** entity. Choose what to include in the request body based on the following:

- If you want to create a submission with the email content itself, include an **emailContentThreatSubmission** object.
- If you want to create a submission with a URL that points to the email, include an **emailUrlThreatSubmission** object.

After the **emailContentThreatSubmission** or **emailUrlThreatSubmision** objects are created, the threat submission service just stores some metadata about the email. The email content is not stored. As a result, an **emailThreatSubmission** entity is created.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [emailThreatSubmission](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-emailthreatsubmission?view=graph-rest-beta) object in the response body.
