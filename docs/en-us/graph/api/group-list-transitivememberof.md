# List group transitive memberOf

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get groups that the [group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) is a member of. This operation is transitive and will also include all groups that this group is a nested member of. Unlike getting a user's Microsoft 365 groups, this returns all types of groups, not just Microsoft 365 groups.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | GroupMember.ReadBasic.All | Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Group.Read.All, Group.ReadBasic.All, GroupMember.Read.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | GroupMember.ReadBasic.All | Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadBasic.All |

Important

When an application queries a relationship that returns a **directoryObject** type collection, if it doesn't have permission to read a certain resource type, members of that type are returned but with limited information. For example, only the **@odata.type** property for the object type and the **id** is returned, while other properties are indicated as `null`. With this behavior, applications can request the least privileged permissions they need, rather than rely on the set of *Directory.*\* permissions. For details, see [Limited information returned for inaccessible member objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#limited-information-returned-for-inaccessible-member-objects).

## HTTP request

```http
GET /groups/{id}/transitiveMemberOf
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

- OData cast is enabled. For example, `/groups/{id}/transitiveMemberOf/microsoft.graph.group` retrieves only groups the group is a member of, either directly or indirectly.
- `$search` is supported on the **displayName** and **description** properties only.
- The default and maximum page size is 100 and 999 group objects respectively.
- The use of query parameters with this API, except for `$expand`, is supported only with advanced query parameters. `$expand` isn't supported with advanced query parameters. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using the `$search`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, or OData cast query parameters. It uses an index that might not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [directoryObject](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/directoryobject?view=graph-rest-1.0) objects in the response body.
