# List resourceActions

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Get a list of the [unifiedRbacResourceAction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/unifiedrbacresourceaction?view=graph-rest-beta) objects and their properties.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | RoleManagement.Read.Directory | RoleManagement.Read.All, RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | RoleManagement.Read.Directory | RoleManagement.Read.All, RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. This operation supports the following built-in roles, which provide only the least privilege necessary:

- Directory Readers
- Global Reader
- Privileged Role Administrator

## HTTP request

```http
GET /roleManagement/directory/resourceNamespaces/{unifiedRbacResourceNamespaceId}/resourceActions
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$filter`, `$select`, `$top`, and `$skipToken` OData query parameters to help customize the response. This method supports `$filter` \(`eq`\) for **actionVerb**, **description**, **id**, **isPrivileged**, and **name** properties. This method returns a default page size of 100 **resourceActions** and supports `$top` and `$skipToken` for paging. For general information, see [OData query parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters).

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [unifiedRbacResourceAction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/unifiedrbacresourceaction?view=graph-rest-beta) objects in the response body.

## Examples

### Example 1: List microsoft.directory actions

The following example lists the actions for the resource namespace with the identifier of `microsoft.directory`.

This method returns a maximum of 100 actions. If there are more actions, you can use `@odata.nextLink` to get the next set of actions. To retrieve a larger set of actions, use the `$top` parameter.
