# sourceCollection: purgeData

Namespace: microsoft.graph.ediscovery

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Caution

The eDiscovery APIs in the microsoft.graph.eDiscovery subnamespace are deprecated. Use the new [eDiscovery APIs under microsoft.graph.security subnamespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-api-overview#ediscovery).

Permanently delete Microsoft Teams messages contained in a [sourceCollection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/ediscovery-sourcecollection?view=graph-rest-beta).

> **Note:** This request purges Teams data only. It doesn't purge other types of data such as mailbox items.

You can collect and purge the following categories of Teams content:

- **Teams 1:1 chats** - Chat messages, posts, and attachments shared in a Teams conversation between two people. Teams 1:1 chats are also called *conversations*.
- **Teams group chats** - Chat messages, posts, and attachments shared in a Teams conversation between three or more people. Also called *1:N* chats or *group conversations*.
- **Teams channels** - Chat messages, posts, replies, and attachments shared in a standard Teams channel.
- **Private channels** - Message posts, replies, and attachments shared in a private Teams channel.
- **Shared channels** - Message posts, replies, and attachments shared in a shared Teams channel.

For more information about purging Teams messages, see:

- [eDiscovery solution series: Data spillage scenario - Search and purge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/data-spillage-scenariosearch-and-purge)
- [Advanced eDiscovery workflow for content in Microsoft Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/teams-workflow-in-advanced-ediscovery)

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

## HTTP request

```http
POST /compliance/ediscovery/cases/{caseId}/sourceCollections/{sourceCollectionId}/purgeData
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this action returns a `202 Accepted` response code.

If the purge data operation is started successfully, this action returns a `202 Accepted` response code. The response will also contain a `Location` header, which contains the location of the [Purge data operation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/ediscovery-purgedataoperation?view=graph-rest-beta) that was created to commit the purge. To check the status of the purge data operation, make a GET request to the location URL. When the request successfully completes, the [status](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/ediscovery-caseoperation?view=graph-rest-beta#caseoperationstatus-values) will change to `succeeded`.
