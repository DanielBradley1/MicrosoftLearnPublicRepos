# call: mute

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Allows the application to mute itself.

This is a server mute, meaning that the server will drop all audio packets for this participant, even if the participant continues to stream audio.

For more details about how to handle mute operations, see [muteParticipantOperation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/muteparticipantoperation?view=graph-rest-1.0)

> **Note:** This method is only supported for group calls.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Calls.Initiate.All | Calls.AccessMedia.All |

> **Note:** Permissions are checked when the call is created; no additional permission check is made when calling this API. Calls.AccessMedia.All is only necessary for calls that use app-hosted media.
