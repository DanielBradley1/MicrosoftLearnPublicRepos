| enableOuterIdentityPrivacy | String | Enable identity privacy \(Outer Identity\) when EAP Type is configured to EAP-TTLS, EAP-FAST or PEAP. This property masks usernames with the text you enter. For example, if you use 'anonymous', each user that authenticates with this wired network using their real username is displayed as 'anonymous'. |
| deploymentChannel | [appleDeploymentChannel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-deviceconfig-appledeploymentchannel?view=graph-rest-beta) | Indicates the deployment channel type used to deploy the configuration profile. Possible values are deviceChannel, userChannel. Possible values are: `deviceChannel`, `userChannel`, `unknownFutureValue`. |
