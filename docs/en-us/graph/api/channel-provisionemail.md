# channel: provisionEmail

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Provision an email address for a [channel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/channel?view=graph-rest-1.0).

Microsoft Teams doesn't automatically provision an email address for a **channel** by default. To have Teams provision an email address, you can call **provisionEmail**, or through the Teams user interface, select **Get email address**, which triggers Teams to generate an email address if it has not already provisioned one.

To remove the email address of a **channel**, use the [removeEmail](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/channel-removeemail?view=graph-rest-1.0) method.
