# driveItem: unarchive

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Unarchive a [driveItem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/driveitem?view=graph-rest-beta).

When unarchiving a single recently archived file, the file is unarchived immediately. Otherwise, the archived file starts the reactivation process.

Note

Unarchiving a driveItem file is not supported when the request includes the Prefer: respond-async header.

When unarchiving a folder using an asynchronous request, a [monitor URL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/long-running-actions-overview) is returned in the response. Use the monitor URL to track progress until the operation completes.

Note

Unarchiving a driveItem folder is supported only when the request includes the Prefer: respond-async header

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | Files.ReadWrite | Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.FullControl.All, Sites.Manage.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Files.ReadWrite.All | Sites.FullControl.All, Sites.Manage.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this action returns a `200 OK` response code for a [driveItem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/driveitem?view=graph-rest-beta) file. The response body will include the driveItem’s metadata, with the archiveStatus property included under the [FileFacet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/file?view=graph-rest-beta).

Otherwise, if successful, this action returns a `202 Accepted` response code, with a monitor URI, for a [driveItem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/driveitem?view=graph-rest-beta) folder.
