# workflow: restore

Namespace: microsoft.graph.identityGovernance

Restore a deleted [workflow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/identitygovernance-workflow?view=graph-rest-1.0) object. You can only restore a workflow that was deleted within the last 30 days before Microsoft Entra ID automatically permanently deletes it.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | LifecycleWorkflows-Workflow.ReadWrite.All | LifecycleWorkflows.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | LifecycleWorkflows-Workflow.ReadWrite.All | LifecycleWorkflows.ReadWrite.All |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. *Lifecycle Workflows Administrator* is the least privileged role supported for this operation.
