## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | Presence.Read | Presence.Read.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | Presence.Read.All | Presence.ReadWrite.All |

Note

- You can't use application permissions to access APIs under the `/me` path.
- The maximum request rate for this API is 1,500 requests within a 30-second period, per application per tenant.

## HTTP Request
