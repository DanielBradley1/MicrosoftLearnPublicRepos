# List group members

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get a list of the [group's](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) direct members. A group can have users, organizational contacts, devices, service principals and other groups as members. This operation is not transitive.

Important

This API has a known issue where service principals are not listed as group members in v1.0. As a workaround, use this API on the `beta` endpoint or use the `/groups/{id}?$expand=members` API. For more information, see the related [known issue](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues#get-groupsidmembers-doesnt-return-service-principals-in-v10).

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | GroupMember.ReadBasic.All | Directory.Read.All, Group.Read.All, Group.ReadBasic.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, GroupMember.Read.All, GroupMember.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | GroupMember.ReadBasic.All | Directory.Read.All, Group.Read.All, Group.ReadBasic.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, GroupMember.Read.All, GroupMember.ReadWrite.All |

Important

When an application queries a relationship that returns a **directoryObject** type collection, if it doesn't have permission to read a certain resource type, members of that type are returned but with limited information. For example, only the **@odata.type** property for the object type and the **id** is returned, while other properties are indicated as `null`. With this behavior, applications can request the least privileged permissions they need, rather than rely on the set of *Directory.*\* permissions. For details, see [Limited information returned for inaccessible member objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#limited-information-returned-for-inaccessible-member-objects).

In delegated scenarios, the signed-in user must also be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with the `microsoft.directory/groups/members/read` or `microsoft.directory/groups/members/limitedRead` role permission, or `microsoft.directory/groups/hiddenMembers/read` role permission to read hidden members. The following least privileged roles are supported for this operation:

- Group owners
- "Member" users
- "Guest" users - have [limited read permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions?context=graph/context#compare-member-and-guest-default-permissions)
- Directory Readers
- Directory Writers
- Groups Administrator
- User Administrator - Including hidden members
- Exchange Administrator - Including hidden members
- SharePoint Administrator - Including hidden members
- Intune Administrator - Including hidden members
- Teams Administrator - Including hidden members
- Yammer Administrator - Including hidden members

To list the members of a hidden membership group, the *Member.Read.Hidden* permission is also required.

## HTTP request

```http
GET /groups/{id}/members
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$filter`, `$count`, `$select`, `$search`, `$top`, and `$expand` [OData query parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

- OData cast is enabled. For example, `/groups/{id}/members/microsoft.graph.user` retrieves group members that are users.
- `$search` is supported on the **displayName** and **description** properties only.
- The use of query parameters with this API, except for `$expand`, is supported only with advanced query parameters. `$expand` isn't supported with advanced query parameters. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

The default and maximum page size is 100 and 999 group objects respectively.

## Request headers

| Header | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using the `$search`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, or OData cast query parameters. It uses an index that might not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [directoryObject](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/directoryobject?view=graph-rest-1.0) objects in the response body.

An attempt to filter by an OData cast that represents an unsupported member type returns a `400 Bad Request` error with the `Request_UnsupportedQuery` code. For example, `/groups/{id}}/members/microsoft.graph.group` when the group is a Microsoft 365 group will return this error, because Microsoft 365 groups cannot have other groups as members.
