# Get a scopedRoleMember

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get a Microsoft Entra role assignment with administrative unit scope.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | RoleManagement.Read.Directory | RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | RoleManagement.Read.Directory | RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be a member user or be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. This operation supports the following built-in roles, which provide only the least privilege necessary:

- Directory Readers - Read *basic* properties and members of administrative units
- Global Reader - Read *all* properties of administrative units, including members
- Privileged Role Administrator - Fully manage administrative units, including members, but excluding restricted administrative units. For more information, see [Restricted management administrative units in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-restricted-management)
