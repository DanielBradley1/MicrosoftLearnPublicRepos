# Add identityProvider to a b2cIdentityUserFlow \(deprecated\)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Caution

This identity provider API is deprecated and will stop returning data after March, 2023. Please use the new [identity provider API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/identityproviderbase).

Add identity providers in a [b2cIdentityUserFlow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/b2cidentityuserflow?view=graph-rest-beta) object.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | IdentityUserFlow.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | IdentityUserFlow.ReadWrite.All | Not available. |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. *External ID User Flow Administrator* is the least privileged role supported for this operation.

## HTTP request

```http
POST /identity/b2cUserFlows/{id}/identityProviders/$ref
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| Content-Type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, provide a JSON representation of the `id` of the [identityProvider](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/identityprovider?view=graph-rest-beta) you want to add. For more information about identity providers available for user flows, see the [identityProviders](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/identityprovider?view=graph-rest-beta) API reference.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code. If unsuccessful, a `4xx` error will be returned with specific details.
