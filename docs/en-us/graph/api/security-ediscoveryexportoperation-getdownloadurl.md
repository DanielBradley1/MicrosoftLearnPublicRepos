# ediscoveryExportOperation: getDownloadUrl \(deprecated\)

Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Caution

The **getDownloadUrl** method is deprecated and will stop returning data on April 30th, 2023. Please use the new **exportFileMetadata** property returned by the [Get caseOperation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/security-caseoperation-get?view=graph-rest-beta) API instead.

If an Azure blob URL is not provided in export action, the export operation exports the files to an internal store. Contents of this store can be fetched by calling into this function. This returns a download URL where the zipped content is delivered as a stream.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | eDiscovery.Read.All | eDiscovery.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | eDiscovery.Read.All | eDiscovery.ReadWrite.All |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Purview role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/edisc-permissions) through one of the following options:

- **eDiscovery Manager**. Allows members to view and access eDiscovery cases they create, including searching and accessing case data. However, eDiscovery Managers can only access and manage the cases they create. **This is the least privileged option for managing their own cases**.
- **eDiscovery Administrator**. Provides all the permissions of eDiscovery Manager, plus the ability to view and access all eDiscovery cases in the organization.

Additional roles that provide read access to eDiscovery cases:

- **Compliance Administrator**. Includes Case Management and Compliance Search permissions.
- **Organization Management**. Includes Case Management and Compliance Search permissions.
- **Reviewer**. Provides read-only access to review sets within eDiscovery cases where the user is a member.

The eDiscovery Manager and eDiscovery Administrator roles are part of the Microsoft Purview role groups and provide access to eDiscovery features through [role-based access control \(RBAC\)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/edisc-permissions#rbac-roles-related-to-ediscovery).

For more information about eDiscovery permissions and roles, see [Assign permissions in eDiscovery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/edisc-permissions).

Important

Microsoft Graph SDKs use the v1.0 version of the API by default, and do not support all the types, properties, and APIs available in the beta version. For details about accessing the beta API with the SDK, see [Use the Microsoft Graph SDKs with the beta API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/use-beta).

For details about how to [add the SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/sdk-installation) to your project and [create an authProvider](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers) instance, see the [SDK documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/sdks-overview).
