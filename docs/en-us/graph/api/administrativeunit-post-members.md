# Add a member

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Use this API to add a member \(user, group, or device\) to an administrative unit. Currently it's only possible to add one member at a time to an administrative unit.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

### Permissions to add an existing user, group, or device

| Permission type | Permissions \(from least to most privileged\) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. |
| Application | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be a member user or be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. *Privileged Role Administrator* is the least privileged role supported for this operation.

### Permissions to create a new group

| Permission type | Permissions \(from least to most privileged\) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | Group.ReadWrite.All and AdministrativeUnit.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. |
| Application | Group.Create and AdministrativeUnit.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All and AdministrativeUnit.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

Important

To create a new group in an administrative unit, the calling principal must be assigned at least one of the following [Microsoft Entra roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) at the scope of the administrative unit:

- Groups Administrator
- User Administrator

For app-only scenarios - apart from these roles, the service principal requires additional permissions to read the directory. These permissions can be granted via assignment of supported Microsoft Entra roles, such the Directory Readers role; or they can be granted via Microsoft Graph application permissions that allow reading the directory, such as *Directory.Read.All*.

## HTTP request

The following request adds an existing user, group, or device to the administrative unit.

```http
POST /directory/administrativeUnits/{id}/members/$ref
```

The following request creates a new group within the administrative unit.

```http
POST /directory/administrativeUnits/{id}/members
```

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

### Adding an existing user, group, or device

In the request body, provide the ID of a [user](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-1.0), [group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0), [device](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/device?view=graph-rest-1.0), or [directoryObject](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/directoryobject?view=graph-rest-1.0) to be added. If the administrative unit is a restricted management administrative unit \(`"isMemberManagementRestricted": true`\), the group type must be a Microsoft Entra security group. Only nonunified groups that are security-enabled, not mail-enabled, and not on-premises sync-enabled are supported.

### Creating a new group

The following table shows the properties of the [group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) resource to specify when you create a group in the administrative unit.

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| displayName | string | The name to display in the address book for the group. Required. |
| description | string | A description for the group. Optional. |
| isAssignableToRole | Boolean | Set to **true** to enable the group to be assigned to a Microsoft Entra role. Privileged Role Administrator is the least privileged role to set the value of this property. Optional. |
| mailEnabled | Boolean | Set to **true** for mail-enabled groups. Required. |
| mailNickname | string | The mail alias for the group. These characters can't be used in the mailNickName: `@()\[]";:.<>,SPACE`. Required. |
| securityEnabled | Boolean | Set to **true** for security-enabled groups, including Microsoft 365 groups. Required. |
| owners | [directoryObject](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/directoryobject?view=graph-rest-1.0) collection | This property represents the owners for the group at creation time. Optional. |
| members | [directoryObject](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/directoryobject?view=graph-rest-1.0) collection | This property represents the members for the group at creation time. Optional. |
| visibility | String | Specifies the visibility of a Microsoft 365 group. The possible values are: `Private`, `Public`, `HiddenMembership`, or empty \(which is interpreted as `Public`\). |

## Response

If successful, adding an existing object \(using `$ref`\) returns `204 No Content` response code. It doesn't return anything in the response body.

When creating a new group \(without `$ref`\), this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0) object in the response body. The response includes only the default properties of the group. You must supply the `"@odata.type" : "#microsoft.graph.group"` line in the request body to explicitly identify the new member as a group. A request body without the correct @odata.type returns a `400 Bad Request` error message.
