# Get administrativeUnit

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve the properties and relationships of an [administrativeUnit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/administrativeunit?view=graph-rest-1.0) object.

The **administrativeUnit** resource supports [extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/extensibility-overview), which also allows you to use the `GET` operation to get custom properties and extension data in an **administrativeUnit** instance.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | AdministrativeUnit.Read.All | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | AdministrativeUnit.Read.All | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be a member user or be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. This operation supports the following built-in roles, which provide only the least privilege necessary:

- Directory Readers - Read *basic* properties and members of administrative units
- Global Reader - Read *all* properties of administrative units, including members
- Privileged Role Administrator - Fully manage administrative units, including members, but excluding restricted administrative units. For more information, see [Restricted management administrative units in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-restricted-management)

## HTTP request

```http
GET /directory/administrativeUnits/{id}
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select` [OData query parameter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. Extension properties also support query parameters as follows:

| Extension type | Comments |

| Schema extensions | Returned only with `$select`. Supports `$filter` \(`eq`\). |
| Directory extensions | Returned by default. Supports `$filter` \(`eq`\). |

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and [administrativeUnit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/administrativeunit?view=graph-rest-1.0) object in the response body.
