# Get alert

Namespace: microsoft.graph.healthMonitoring

Important

APIs under the `/beta` version in Microsoft Graph are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported. To determine whether an API is available in v1.0, use the **Version** selector.

Read the properties and relationships of a Microsoft Entra health monitoring [alert](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/healthmonitoring-alert?view=graph-rest-beta) object. The returned alert object contains information about the state, type, date, and impact of each alert that fired within your tenant.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | HealthMonitoringAlert.Read.All | HealthMonitoringAlert.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | HealthMonitoringAlert.Read.All | HealthMonitoringAlert.ReadWrite.All |

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the admin must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json). This operation supports the following built-in roles, which provide only the least privilege necessary:

- Global Reader
- Security Administrator
- Security Operator
- Security Reader
- Helpdesk Administrator
- Reports Reader

## HTTP request

```http
GET /reports/healthMonitoring/alerts/{alertId}
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select` and `$expand` [OData query parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

When no `$expand` query parameter is added, this API doesn't return `resourceSampling` property by default. When you want to retrieve a sample of the resources involved in triggering the alert for root cause investigation, you can add `$expand=enrichment/impacts/microsoft.graph.healthmonitoring.directoryobjectimpactsummary/resourceSampling` to view `resourceSampling` in [directoryObjectImpactSummary](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/healthmonitoring-directoryobjectimpactsummary?view=graph-rest-beta).

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members | Enables evolvable enum values beyond the sentinel value. For more information, see [Best practices for working with Microsoft Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/best-practices-concept#handling-future-members-in-evolvable-enumerations). Optional. |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [microsoft.graph.healthMonitoring.alert](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/healthmonitoring-alert?view=graph-rest-beta) object in the response body.
