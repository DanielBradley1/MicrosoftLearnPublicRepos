# List members

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Use this API to get the members list \(users, groups, or devices\) in an administrative unit.

This API is available in the following [national cloud deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments).

| Global service | US Government L4 | US Government L5 \(DOD\) | China operated by 21Vianet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Least privileged permissions | Higher privileged permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Delegated \(work or school account\) | AdministrativeUnit.Read.All | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated \(personal Microsoft account\) | Not supported. | Not supported. |
| Application | AdministrativeUnit.Read.All | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

Important

When an application queries a relationship that returns a **directoryObject** type collection, if it doesn't have permission to read a certain resource type, members of that type are returned but with limited information. For example, only the **@odata.type** property for the object type and the **id** is returned, while other properties are indicated as `null`. With this behavior, applications can request the least privileged permissions they need, rather than rely on the set of *Directory.*\* permissions. For details, see [Limited information returned for inaccessible member objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview#limited-information-returned-for-inaccessible-member-objects).

> **Note:** To list the members of a hidden membership in an administrative unit, the *Member.Read.Hidden* permission is also required.

Important

For delegated access using work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be a member user or be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role that grants the permissions required for this operation. This operation supports the following built-in roles, which provide only the least privilege necessary:

- Directory Readers - Read *basic* properties and members of administrative units
- Global Reader - Read *all* properties of administrative units, including members
- Privileged Role Administrator - Fully manage administrative units, including members, but excluding restricted administrative units. For more information, see [Restricted management administrative units in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-restricted-management)

## HTTP request

```http
GET /directory/administrativeUnits/{id}/members
GET /directory/administrativeUnits/{id}/members/$ref
```

## Optional query parameters

This method \(when used without `$ref`\) supports the `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter` [OData query parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. OData cast is also enabled. For example, you can cast to get just the users that are a member of the administrative unit.

`$search` is supported on the **displayName** and **description** properties only. The use of query parameters with this API is supported only with advanced query parameters. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. Learn more about [authentication and authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts). |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or in specific usage of `$filter`. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [user](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-1.0), [group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-1.0), or [device](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/device?view=graph-rest-1.0) objects in the response body. Adding `$ref` at the end of the request returns a collection of only `@odata.id` URLs of the members.
