- Step 5: [Prepare identity mapping](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/migration/cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step5?view=o365-worldwide)
- Step 6: [Start a Cross-tenant OneDrive migration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/migration/cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step6?view=o365-worldwide)
- Step 7: [Post migration steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/migration/cross-tenant-onedrive-migration-step7?view=o365-worldwide)

Before proceeding with your migration, you need to verify the trust is complete. A status of *GoodToProceed* confirms that the trust is verified.

## To verify trust is established

1. On the **source tenant** run:

```powershell

Verify-SPOCrossTenantRelationship -Scenario MnA -PartnerRole Target -PartnerCrossTenantHostUrl <TARGETCrossTenantHostUrl>
```

2. On the **target tenant** run:

```powershell

Verify-SPOCrossTenantRelationship -Scenario MnA -PartnerRole Source -PartnerCrossTenantHostUrl <SOURCECrossTenantHostUrl>
```

## Troubleshooting trust issues

When verifying trust, possible values

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| NotEstablished | Trust wasn't requested locally. |
| NotEstablishedByPartner | Partner didn't request the Trust. |
| DormantByPartner | Partner's requested trust is within the seven days waiting period after creation. |
| CouldNotContactPartner | Couldn't contact the partner to determine status. |
| GoodToProceed | Verified to proceed. |
