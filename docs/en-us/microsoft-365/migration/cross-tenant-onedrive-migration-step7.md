## Removing trust relationship

Important

Ensure you remove the Trust Relationship on both source and target tenants before your source tenant licenses expire. Once the licenses expire, the trust removal command doesn't work on the source.

1. On the source tenant, run this command to remove the trust relationship between Source and Target tenant.

   ```powershell
   Remove-SPOCrossTenantRelationship -Scenario MnA -PartnerRole Target -PartnerCrossTenantHostUrl <TARGETCrossTenantHostUrl>
   ```

2. On the target tenant, run this command to remove the trust relationship between the target and source tenant.

   ```powershell
   Remove-SPOCrossTenantRelationship -Scenario MnA -PartnerRole Target -PartnerCrossTenantHostUrl <TARGETCrossTenantHostUrl>
   ```

### Parameter definitions

| Parameter | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| PartnerRole | Roles of the partner tenant you're establishing trust with. Use *source* if partner tenant is the source of the OneDrive migrations, and *target* if the partner tenant is the destination. |
| PartnerCrossTenantHostURL | The cross-tenant host URL of the partner tenant. The partner tenant can determine this URL for you by running: *Get-SPOCrossTenantHostURL* on each of the tenants. |

## Removing redirect links post migration

After you complete the migration from Source to Target, a redirect link is placed on the source. If users attempt to log back into their Source account or site, the link automatically redirects them to their new Target site. Remove the redirect links on the source after your full migration is complete.

![flow chart of how redirects are created.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/media/cross-tenant-migration/t2t-onedrive-redirect-workflow.png?view=o365-worldwide)

Occasionally, a user may need to be migrated back to the original source. Remove the redirect link on the Target if you migrate a user back to the source.

- To remove redirect links, use the **Remove-SPOSite** PowerShell command.
- To get a list of all redirect sites on a tenant, use the **Get-Sposite -Template RedirectSite#0** command.

Keep track of any user or site you migrate back to the source from the target. After successfully migrating these users or sites back to the source, confirm that the user and sites are accessible. Then you can remove the redirect link from Target using the **Remove-SPOSite command**.

Important

Site URLs must be unique. When migrating a user or site back to the source, the redirect site created on the initial move uses the original URL. This circumstance results in a conflict and causes the migration to fail if not removed.

## Other post migration steps

Once the migration completes, OneDrive users must sign in using their new identity and resync their files to their devices on the target tenant.

### OneDrive

With their new credentials, have users sign in to OneDrive using the Microsoft 365 app launcher or a web browser.

### Permissions on OneDrive content

Users with permission to access OneDrive content continue to be able to access it, provided they were included in the identity mapping file.

### OneDrive Sync Client

The user must sign in to the **OneDrive Sync Client** and their new OneDrive location using their new identity. Once you complete that step, the files and folders begin resyncing to the device.

### Sharing Links

The existing shared links for the migrated files automatically redirect to the new target location.
