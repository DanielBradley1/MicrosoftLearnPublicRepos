# Data, privacy, and security for web search in Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat

Note

Microsoft 365 Copilot is now named Microsoft Copilot, and Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat is now named Microsoft Copilot Chat. Some experiences, licenses, and capabilities might continue to reference Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat during the transition period. There are no changes to security, compliance, and privacy for organizations.

Microsoft Copilot and [Microsoft Copilot Chat](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/overview) have an optional feature that allows Copilot to reference web content when responding to user prompts. Allowing Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat to reference web content improves the quality of Copilot responses by grounding them in the latest information from the web.

Note

- This article concerns the web search functionality in Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat. Microsoft Copilot Search is an additional, universal search experience that allows users with a Microsoft Copilot license to search across all their Microsoft 365 and third-party data sources. Learn more about [Microsoft Copilot Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-search).
- The information about web search in this article also applies to [Researcher](https://support.microsoft.com/Microsoft-365-Copilot/get-started-with-researcher-in-microsoft-365-copilot), [Analyst](https://support.microsoft.com/Microsoft-365-Copilot/get-started-with-analyst-in-microsoft-365-copilot), and [Cowork](https://support.microsoft.com/Microsoft-365-Copilot/get-started-with-cowork) in Microsoft Copilot. While web search isn't a prerequisite for using Researcher, Analyst, and Cowork, enabling web search is recommended to get the most value out of using them. Researcher has a **Web search** toggle accessible in the input box. Analyst and Cowork don't have a **Web search** toggle for users.

## Web search

When web search is enabled, Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat may fetch information from the Bing search service when information from the web helps to provide a better, more grounded response. Admin controls and a user-level Web content toggle are available for eligible Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat users.

### How web search works

When web search is enabled, Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat parse the user's prompt and identifies terms where information from the web would improve the quality of the response. Based on these terms, Copilot generates a search query that it sends to the Bing search service asking for more information.

This generated search query is different from the user's original prompt-it consists of a few words informed by the user's prompt. The following information isn't included in the generated search query sent to the Bing search service:

- The user's entire prompt, unless the prompt is very short \(for example, "local weather"\)
- Entire Microsoft 365 files \(for example, emails or documents\) or files uploaded into Copilot
- Entire web pages or PDFs summarized by Copilot in Microsoft Edge \(only for Microsoft Copilot Chat\)
- Any identifying information based on the user's Microsoft Entra ID \(for example, username, domain, or tenant ID\)

When using Microsoft Copilot, the generated search query doesn't include the entirety of Microsoft 365 documents associated with the prompt. However, it may also be informed by data within a Microsoft 365 document under the following conditions:

- When a user enters a prompt into Copilot inside a Microsoft 365 application \(for example, writing a prompt into Copilot in Microsoft Word while a relevant document is open\).
- When the user explicitly references a specific document in their prompt.

The user's prompts and Copilot's responses are stored within Microsoft 365 and never leave the service boundary for both Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat without customer direction. [Enterprise data protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/enterprise-data-protection), the [Data Protection Addendum \(DPA\)](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Microsoft-Products-and-Services-Data-Protection-Addendum-DPA), and the [Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/PrivacyandSecurityTerms/all) apply to prompts and responses, with Microsoft acting as a data processor.

After Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat receive additional information from the Bing search service, this information is used to compose the response returned to the user.

### Web search query citations

To provide greater visibility into the generated search queries, web search query citations are shown to users in the linked citation section of the Copilot response. The section shows the exact web search queries \(derived from the user's prompt\) that were sent to the Bing search service. Showing the exact web search queries helps users understand what search queries, along with the sites searched, were used to enhance Copilot's response to their prompt. This information can help users improve their prompts and use Copilot more effectively.

![Screenshot of web search query citations in Microsoft Copilot.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/media/copilot-web-search-citations-raw.png)

Web search query citations are available only in Microsoft Copilot Chat. Citations aren't available in the Copilot pane within a Microsoft 365 app, such as Word or PowerPoint. Also, the web search queries are only available in the chat thread for 24 hours.

### Web search query logging

Web search query logging is available so that admins can perform search, audit, and eDiscovery on the exact web search queries Copilot derived from the user's prompt. Admins can already perform these actions for prompts and responses and are able to use their familiar tools to extend those actions to search queries. For more information, see [Audit log activities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/audit-log-activities#copilot-activities), [Copilot interaction events overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/copilot-schema), and [Search for and delete AI application data in eDiscovery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/edisc-search-copilot-data).

Administrators can also view the actual web search terms Copilot used, right alongside the original prompt, the response, and any supporting resources by using activity explorer in Microsoft Purview Data Security Posture Management \(DSPM\) for AI. For more information, see [Learn about Data Security Posture Management \(DSPM\) for AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/dspm-for-ai).

### Examples of generated search queries

The following table provides multiple examples of a user's prompt and the generated search queries sent to Bing. It also explains how Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat formulate a response. Brackets indicate placeholders for specific information referenced by the user or inferred by Copilot.

Note

Unlike with Microsoft Copilot, users can't invoke organizational content like files, emails, or chats, when prompting in Microsoft Copilot Chat. For examples of purely web-based user prompts for Microsoft Copilot Chat, see [Privacy and security of generated search queries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/privacy-and-protections#privacy-and-security-of-generated-search-queries).

| User prompt | Generated search queries | How Copilot provides a response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Who is my manager and what public information is available about them? | \[Manager name\] | Copilot finds the name of the user's manager from Microsoft 365 data. It then generates a Bing search query based on their name to see what information about them is available on the web. |
| I'm looking for a document authored last week by \[coworker\]. | None | Copilot returns documents by \[coworker\] found in Microsoft 365 data. No web search queries are generated. |
| We're considering a possible acquisition of Fabrikam. Summarize financial information about the company, including their business strategy. | Fabrikam strategy  <br>Fabrikam financials | Copilot returns a response with two sections. One is headlined "From your company's data" that references information the user has access to in Microsoft 365. The other is headlined "From the web," which includes any publicly available information. |
| What decision did \[coworker\] make about shipping our Contoso product? | \[Coworker name\] decision about shipping Contoso product | Copilot returns a response based on information the user has access to in Microsoft 365.  <br>  <br>Because there's no relevant information available on the web, Copilot doesn't include information from the web in the response. |
| Summarize \[internal strategy document about clean energy\] and tell me if Fabrikam has publicly announced a similar approach. | Fabrikam clean energy policy announcements | The user explicitly includes a reference to a specific document in Microsoft 365. Copilot reasons over this document and identifies "clean energy policy" as a major theme. "Clean energy policy" is added to the generated search query sent to the Bing search service \(the document itself isn't included\).  <br>  <br>Copilot then takes web results returned from Bing and identifies any similarities between this public information and the strategy described in the internal document. |

### How Microsoft handles generated search queries

Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat both use generated search queries sent to the Bing search service to ground responses in web data. The way Microsoft handles these queries is identical in both services.

Generated search queries are sent to the Bing search service with user and tenant identifiers removed. Also, web search queries sent to Bing don't affect any of the following:

- Search Ranking
- Answers or features like Rich Captions
- Social features like Auto Suggest, Trending, and Zero Input

The "Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat" section of the [Product Terms](https://aka.ms/copilot/web-query-terms) provides the following additional commitments about the generated search queries sent to the Bing search service:

- Microsoft has no rights to them other than as needed to provide the service.
- They aren't used to improve Bing.
- They aren't used to create advertising profiles or to track user behavior.
- They aren't shared with advertisers.
- They aren't used to train generative AI foundation models.
- They're treated as customer confidential information and protected by appropriate technical and organizational measures.

The Bing search service operates separately from Microsoft 365 and has different data-handling practices. The web search queries generated by Copilot and sent to Bing are subject to the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement) between each user and Microsoft, together with the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://www.microsoft.com/privacy/privacystatement).

The [Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/PrivacyandSecurityTerms/all) add additional commitments on Microsoft as a controller with respect to handling of web query data. Microsoft acts as a data controller, responsible for complying with all applicable laws and controller obligations. In the event of conflict with respect to the use of Bing with Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat, the Product Terms supersede the Microsoft Services Agreement and the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

The [Microsoft Products and Services Data Protection Addendum \(DPA\)](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Microsoft-Products-and-Services-Data-Protection-Addendum-DPA) doesn't apply to the use of generated web search queries in Microsoft Copilot, Microsoft Copilot Chat, or the Bing search service. Also, HIPAA compliance and the [EU Data Boundary](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/privacy/eudb/eu-data-boundary-learn) don't apply to generated search queries.

## Controls available to manage web search

To manage web search so it aligns with organizational policies, user preferences, and security considerations, two distinct controls are available: one for IT admins and another for users.

### IT admin control for both Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat

The primary way that IT admins can control access to web search is by using the **Allow web search in Copilot** policy, which is available only in [Cloud Policy service for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-apps/admin-center/overview-cloud-policy). This policy allows IT admins to either turn on or turn off web search for users or user groups across the tenant they manage in accordance with their organization's policies, data privacy laws, or other regulatory requirements. This policy applies to both Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat.

If the IT admin enables the **Allow web search in Copilot** policy, they have three options for web search in Copilot:

- Enabled in Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat
- Disabled in Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat
- Disabled in Microsoft Copilot Work mode; Enabled in Microsoft Copilot Web mode and Microsoft Copilot Chat

If the IT admin turns on web search for Microsoft Copilot users, those users still have the option to turn off web search by using the [Web content toggle](#web-content-toggle-for-users).

If the IT admin turns off web search, the **Web content** toggle is turned off and appears dimmed. Users can't turn on the toggle to use web search.

Note

If the IT admin chooses the **Disabled in Microsoft Copilot Work mode; Enabled in Microsoft Copilot Web mode and Microsoft Copilot Chat** option, web search in [Researcher](https://support.microsoft.com/Microsoft-365-Copilot/get-started-with-researcher-in-microsoft-365-copilot) and [Cowork](https://support.microsoft.com/Microsoft-365-Copilot/get-started-with-cowork) in Microsoft Copilot will be disabled.

If the IT admin doesn't configure the **Allow web search in Copilot** policy, web search will be available to users in both Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat, unless the IT admin has set the **Allow the use of additional optional connected experiences in Office** policy to **Disabled**. But turning off optional connected experiences restricts Microsoft Copilot Chat, Microsoft Copilot, and multiple experiences across Microsoft 365.

Note

For United States government customers using Microsoft 365 \(or Office 365\) Government Community Cloud \(GCC\) or DoD offerings:

- Web search is available, but is turned off by default.
- To enable web search, use the **Allow web search in Copilot** policy in Cloud Policy service for Microsoft 365. For information about this policy, refer to the information earlier in this section.
- If you don't configure the **Allow web search in Copilot** policy, web search remains turned off, regardless of how the **Allow the use of additional optional connected experiences in Office** policy is configured.

### Web content toggle for users

The **Web content** toggle gives users control over whether Microsoft Copilot includes real-time web content in responses and is now available to both Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Chat users.

If the IT admin enables web search, the **Web content** toggle is turned on by default. When turned on, the user receives responses grounded in real-time web content. If the IT admin disables web search, the **Web content** toggle isn't available to the user and web search is disabled.

If a user turns off the **Web content** toggle, web content isn't included in Copilot responses. User preferences persist across sessions and are applied across supported Copilot clients and devices.

Users can manage web search by following these steps:

1. In the Microsoft Copilot app, open **Settings**, and then select **Personalization**.
2. Expand **Advanced**, and turn off the **Web search** toggle.

   [![Screenshot showing the Copilot personalization settings.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/media/copilot-personalization.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/media/copilot-personalization.png#lightbox)

Note

The privacy setting for optional connected experiences available to users in Microsoft 365 apps \(for example, in Word, Excel, or Teams\) has no effect on the availability of web search. For example, if a user turns off optional connected experiences, web search can still be available to the user.
