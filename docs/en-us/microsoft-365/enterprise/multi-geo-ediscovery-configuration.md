# Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo eDiscovery configuration

[eDiscovery premium features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/edisc) allow a Multi-Geo eDiscovery administrator to search all of the *Geographies* without needing to use a "Region" security filter. Data is exported to the Azure instance of the *Primary Provisioned Geography* location of the multi-geo *Tenant*.

Without eDiscovery premium features enabled, an eDiscovery manager or administrator of a Multi-Geo *Tenant* can conduct eDiscovery only in the *Primary Provisioned Geography* location of that *Tenant*. To support the ability to conduct eDiscovery for *Satellite Geography* locations, a new compliance security filter parameter named "Region" is available through PowerShell. This parameter can be used by *Tenants* whose *Primary Provisioned Geography* location is in North America, Europe, or Asia Pacific. eDiscovery with premium features is required for *Tenants* whose *Primary Provisioned Geography* location isn't in North America, Europe, or Asia Pacific and who need to perform eDiscovery across *Satellite Geography* locations.

A member of the **Organization Management** role group or a user with the **Role Management** role must assign eDiscovery Manager permissions in the Microsoft Purview portal to allow others to perform eDiscovery tasks and assign a "Region" parameter in their applicable Compliance Security Filter to specify the *Geography* for conducting eDiscovery as *Satellite Geography* location. Otherwise, no eDiscovery activities occur for the *Satellite Geography* location. Only one "Region" security filter per user is supported. See [Assign eDiscovery permissions in the Microsoft Purview portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/edisc-permissions) for more information.

When you set the eDiscovery Manager or Administrator role for a particular *Satellite Geography* location, the eDiscovery Manager or Administrator can only perform eDiscovery search actions against the SharePoint sites and OneDrive sites located in that *Satellite Geography* location. If an eDiscovery Manager or Administrator attempts to search SharePoint or OneDrive sites outside the specified *Satellite Geography* location, no results are returned. Also, when the eDiscovery Manager or Administrator for a *Satellite Geography* location triggers an export, data is exported to the Azure instance of that region. This helps organizations stay in compliance by not allowing content to be exported across controlled borders.

Note

If an eDiscovery Manager needs to search across multiple SharePoint *Satellite Geography* locations, create another user account for the eDiscovery Manager that specifies the alternate *Satellite Geography* location where the OneDrive or SharePoint sites are located.

Note

To use a security filter for Italy, New Zealand, Spain, or Sweden in eDiscovery, you must have [premium features in eDiscovery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/edisc-settings-general) enabled.

To set the Compliance Security Filter for a Region:

1. [Connect to Microsoft 365 Security & Compliance PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell)
2. Use the following syntax:

   ```powershell
   New-ComplianceSecurityFilter -Action All -FilterName <TheNameYouWantToAssign> -Region <RegionValue> -Users <UserPrincipalName>
   ```


   For example:


   ```powershell
   New-ComplianceSecurityFilter -Action All -FilterName "NAM eDiscovery Managers" -Region NAM -Users adwood@contoso.onmicrosoft.com
   ```

See the [New-ComplianceSecurityFilter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/new-compliancesecurityfilter) article for more parameters and syntax.
