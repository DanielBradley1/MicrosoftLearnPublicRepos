# Use the Centralized Deployment PowerShell cmdlets to manage add-ins

As a Microsoft 365 global admin, you can deploy Office Add-ins to users via the Centralized Deployment feature \(see [Deploy Office Add-ins in the admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide). In addition to deploying Office Add-ins via the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can also use Microsoft PowerShell.

Important

Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. This helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

Open a regular Windows PowerShell window and run the following cmdlet to install the module:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name O365CentralizedAddInDeployment
```

Run the following cmdlet to import the module:

```powershell
 Import-Module -Name O365CentralizedAddInDeployment
```

## Connect using your admin credentials

Before you can use the Centralized Deployment cmdlets, you need to sign in.

1. Start PowerShell.
2. Connect to PowerShell by using your **Global Admin** credentials. Run the following cmdlet.

```powershell
Connect-OrganizationAddInService
```

3. In the sign in prompt that opens, select or enter your Microsoft 365 **Global Admin** credentials.

Note

For more information about using PowerShell, see [Connect to Microsoft 365 with PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell?view=o365-worldwide).

## Upload an add-in manifest

Run the **New-OrganizationAdd-In** cmdlet to upload an add-in manifest from a path, which can be either a file location or URL. The following example shows a file location for the value of the *ManifestPath* parameter.

```powershell
New-OrganizationAddIn -ManifestPath 'C:\Users\Me\Desktop\taskpane.xml' -Locale 'en-US'
```

You can also run the **New-OrganizationAdd-In** cmdlet to upload an add-in and assign it to users or groups directly by using the *Members* parameter, as shown in the following example. Separate the email addresses of members with a comma.

```powershell
New-OrganizationAddIn -ManifestPath 'C:\Users\Me\Desktop\taskpane.xml' -Locale 'en-US' -Members  'KathyBonner@contoso.com', 'MaxHargrave@contoso.com'
```

## Upload an add-in from the Microsoft Marketplace

Run the **New-OrganizationAddIn** cmdlet to upload a manifest from the Microsoft Marketplace.

In the following example, the **New-OrganizationAddIn** cmdlet specifies the AssetId for an add-in for a United States location and content market.

```powershell
New-OrganizationAddIn -AssetId 'WA104099688' -Locale 'en-US' -ContentMarket 'en-US'
```

To determine the value for the *AssetId* parameter, you can copy it from the URL of the Microsoft Marketplace webpage for the add-in. AssetIds always begin with "WA" followed by a number. For example, in the previous example, the source for the AssetId value of WA104099688 is the Microsoft Marketplace webpage URL for the add-in: [https://store.office.com/en-001/app.aspx?assetid=WA104099688](https://store.office.com/en-001/app.aspx?assetid=WA104099688).

The values for the *Locale* parameter and the *ContentMarket* parameter are identical and indicate the country/region you're trying to install the add-in from. The format is en-US, fr-FR and so forth.

Note

Add-ins uploaded from the Microsoft Marketplace will update automatically within a few days of the latest update being available on the Microsoft Marketplace.

## Get details of an add-in

Run the **Get-OrganizationAddIn** cmdlet as shown below to get details of all add-ins uploaded to the tenant, included an add-in's product ID.

```powershell
Get-OrganizationAddIn
```

Run the **Get-OrganizationAddIn** cmdlet with a value for the *ProductId* parameter to specify which add-in you want to retrieve details for.

```powershell
Get-OrganizationAddIn -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122
```

To get full details of all the add-ins plus the assigned users and groups, pipe the output of the **Get-OrganizationAddIn** cmdlet to the Format-List cmdlet, as shown in the following example.

```powershell
foreach($G in (Get-organizationAddIn)){Get-OrganizationAddIn -ProductId $G.ProductId | Format-List}
```

## Turn on or turn off an add-in

To turn off an add-in so users and groups that are assigned to it will no longer have access, run the **Set-OrganizationAddIn** cmdlet with the *ProductId* parameter and the *Enabled* parameter set to `$false`, as shown in the following example.

```powershell
Set-OrganizationAddIn -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122 -Enabled $false
```

To turn an add-in back on, run the same cmdlet with the *Enabled* parameter set to `$true`.

```powershell
Set-OrganizationAddIn -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122 -Enabled $true
```

## Add or remove users from an add-in

To add users and groups to a specific add-in, run the **Set-OrganizationAddInAssignments** cmdlet with the *ProductId*, *Add*, and *Members* parameters. Separate the email addresses of members with a comma.

```powershell
Set-OrganizationAddInAssignments -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122 -Add -Members 'KathyBonner@contoso.com','sales@contoso.com'
```

To remove users and groups, run the same cmdlet using the *Remove* parameter.

```powershell
Set-OrganizationAddInAssignments -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122 -Remove -Members 'KathyBonner@contoso.com','sales@contoso.com'
```

To assign an add-in to all users on the tenant, run the same cmdlet using the *AssignToEveryone* parameter with the value set to `$true`.

```powershell
Set-OrganizationAddInAssignments -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122 -AssignToEveryone $true
```

To not assign an add-in to everyone and revert to the previously assigned users and groups, you can run the same cmdlet and turn off the *AssignToEveryone* parameter by setting its value to `$false`.

```powershell
Set-OrganizationAddInAssignments -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122 -AssignToEveryone $false
```

## Update an add-in

To update an add-in from a manifest, run the **Set-OrganizationAddIn** cmdlet with the *ProductId*, *ManifestPath*, and *Locale* parameters, as shown in the following example.

```powershell
Set-OrganizationAddIn -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122 -ManifestPath 'C:\Users\Me\Desktop\taskpane.xml' -Locale 'en-US'
```

Note

Add-ins uploaded from the Microsoft Marketplace will update automatically within a few days of the latest update being available on the Microsoft Marketplace.

## Delete an add-in

To delete an add-in, run the **Remove-OrganizationAddIn** cmdlet with the *ProductId* parameter, as shown in the following example.

```powershell
Remove-OrganizationAddIn -ProductId 6a75788e-1c6b-4e9b-b5db-5975a2072122
```

## Get detailed help for each cmdlet

You can look at detailed help for each cmdlet by using the Get-help cmdlet. For example, the following cmdlet provides detailed information about the Remove-OrganizationAddIn cmdlet.

```powershell
Get-help Remove-OrganizationAddIn -Full
```
