# User Testing in Multi-Geo

In Microsoft Entra there are two types of user objects: cloud only users and synchronized users. Follow the appropriate instructions for your type of user.

Tip

We recommend that you begin validations with a test user or small group of users before rolling out multi-geo to your broader organization.

## Synchronize user's Preferred Data Location \(PDL\) using Microsoft Entra Connect

If your company's users are synchronized from an on-premises Active Directory system to Microsoft Entra ID, their PreferredDataLocation must be populated in AD and synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID.

Follow the process in [Azure Active Directory Connect sync: Configure preferred data location for Microsoft 365 resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-feature-preferreddatalocation) to configure Preferred Data Location sync from your on-premises Active Directory Domain Services \(AD DS\) to Microsoft Entra ID.

We recommend that you include setting the user's Preferred Data Location \(PDL\) as a part of your standard user creation workflow.

Important

For new users with no OneDrive provisioned, license the account and wait at least 48 hours after a user's PDL is synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID for the changes to propagate before the user logs in to OneDrive. \(Setting the preferred data location before the user logs in to provision their OneDrive ensures that the user's new OneDrive will be provisioned in the correct location.\)

## Setting Preferred Data Location \(PDL\) for cloud only users

Note

The Azure Active Directory module is being replaced by the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. You can use the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK to access all Microsoft Graph APIs. For more information, see [Get started with the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/get-started).

Note

Azure AD and MSOnline PowerShell modules are deprecated as of March 30, 2024. To learn more, read the [deprecation update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270). After this date, support for these modules are limited to migration assistance to Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK and security fixes. The deprecated modules will continue to function through March, 30 2025.

We recommend migrating to [Microsoft Graph PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/overview) to interact with Microsoft Entra ID \(formerly Azure AD\). For common migration questions, refer to the [Migration FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/active-directory/migration-faq). *Note:* Versions 1.0.x of MSOnline may experience disruption after June 30, 2024.

First, use a **Microsoft Entra DC admin** or **Cloud Application Admin** account to [connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell?view=o365-worldwide).

```powershell
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes User.ReadWrite.All
```

Use the following script format:

```PowerShell
$userUPN="<user's UPN>"
$user = Get-MgUser -UserId $userUPN
Update-MgUser -UserId $user.Id -PreferredDataLocation <international location code>
```

In this example, you set the user adelev@contoso.com's preferred data location to EUR:

```powershell
$userUPN="adelev@contoso.com"
$user = Get-MgUser -UserId $userUPN
Update-MgUser -UserId $user.Id -PreferredDataLocation EUR
```

You can check to confirm that the preferred data location was updated properly by navigating to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and selecting **Settings > Users > Active Users > \[username\]**. Select the user from the list, and you'll find Preferred Data Location under the **Account** tab of the user's page.

We recommend that you include setting the user's Preferred Data Location as a part of your standard user creation workflow.

Important

For new users with no OneDrive provisioned, license the account and wait at least 48 hours after a user's PDL is set for the changes to propagate before the user logs in to OneDrive. \(Setting the preferred data location before the user logs in to provision their OneDrive ensures that the user's new OneDrive will be provisioned in the correct location.\)

## OneDrive Provisioning and the effect of PDL

If the user already has a OneDrive site created in the *Tenant*, setting their PDL won't automatically move their existing OneDrive. To move a user's OneDrive, see [OneDrive Geo Move](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/move-onedrive-between-geo-locations?view=o365-worldwide).

Note

Exchange Online automatically relocates the user's mailbox if the PDL changes and the MailboxRegion no longer matches the Mailbox Database Geo Location code. For more information, see [Administering Exchange Online mailboxes in a multi-geo environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/administering-exchange-online-multi-geo?view=o365-worldwide).

If the user doesn't have a OneDrive site within the *Tenant*, OneDrive will be provisioned for them in accordance to their PDL value, assuming the PDL for the user matches one of the company's satellite locations.
