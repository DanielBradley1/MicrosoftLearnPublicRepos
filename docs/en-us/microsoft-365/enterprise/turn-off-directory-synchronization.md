# Turn off directory synchronization for Microsoft 365

You can use PowerShell to turn off directory synchronization and convert your synchronized users and groups to cloud-only. However, it isn't recommended that you turn off directory synchronization as a troubleshooting step. If you need assistance with troubleshooting directory synchronization, see the [Fixing problems with directory synchronization for Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/fix-problems-with-directory-synchronization?view=o365-worldwide) article.

[Contact support](https://support.office.com/article/32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b) if you need help with this procedure.

Note

If your goal is to permanently disable synchronization in the tenant, you should first uninstall the synchronization client \(such as Connect Sync or Cloud Sync\). Disabling synchronization before uninstalling the sync client might result in the Entra Id Portal showing directory synchronization as **disabled**, but optional features such as Password Hash Synchronization show as **enabled**. Although this shouldn't cause any issues, and the optional feature wouldn't work when directory synchronization is disabled, it may lead to an unexpected status in the Portal.

## Turn off directory synchronization

To turn off directory synchronization:

1. First, install the required software and connect to your Microsoft 365 subscription. For instructions, see [Connect with the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module for Windows PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/connect-to-microsoft-365-powershell#connect-with-microsoft-graph-powershell).
2. Use **Update-MgOrganization** to disable directory synchronization:

```powershell
  # Install v1.0 Microsoft Graph PowerShell module 
  Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Force
  
  # Connect With Hybrid Identity Administrator Account
  Connect-MgGraph -scopes "Organization.ReadWrite.All,Directory.ReadWrite.All" 
  
  # Verify the current status of the DirSync Type
  Get-MgOrganization | Select OnPremisesSyncEnabled 
  
  # Store the Tenant ID in a variable named organizationId
  $organizationId = (Get-MgOrganization).Id 
  
  # Store the False value for the DirSyncEnabled Attribute
  $params = @{
  	onPremisesSyncEnabled = $false
  }
  
  # Perform the update
  Update-MgOrganization -OrganizationId $organizationId -BodyParameter $params 
  
  # Check that the command worked
  Get-MgOrganization | Select OnPremisesSyncEnabled
```

Note

If you use this command, you must wait 72 hours before you can turn directory synchronization back on. This process will clear the following on-premises properties:

- DnsDomainName
- NetBiosName
- OnPremisesDistinguishedName
- OnPremisesSamAccountName
- OnpremisesUserPrincipalName
