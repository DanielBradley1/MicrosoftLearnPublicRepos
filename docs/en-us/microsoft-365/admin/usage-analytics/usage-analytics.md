# Microsoft 365 usage analytics overview

Important

Starting in March 2026, the **Company**, **City**, and **ProxyAddresses** **field filters** in the User Activity tab will no longer be supported.

To continue filtering activity data by **company**, **city** and **proxy addresses attributes**, you can join metrics from the Microsoft 365 usage report Graph API with your own data sources and build a custom dashboard in Power BI or another data visualization tool of your choice. The following Graph API reports include user-level detail:

[getEmailActivityUserDetail](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/reportroot-getemailactivityuserdetail)  
[getOneDriveActivityUserDetail](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/reportroot-getonedriveactivityuserdetail)  
[getSharePointActivityUserDetail](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/reportroot-getsharepointactivityuserdetail)  
[getSkypeForBusinessActivityUserDetail](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/reportroot-getskypeforbusinessactivityuserdetail)  
[getTeamsUserActivityUserDetail](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/reportroot-getteamsuseractivityuserdetail)  
[getYammerActivityUserDetail](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/reportroot-getyammeractivityuserdetail)  


If using Microsoft 365 usage report Graph API is not an option for your organization, you can also export user detail reports directly from the Microsoft 365 admin center as an alternative.
