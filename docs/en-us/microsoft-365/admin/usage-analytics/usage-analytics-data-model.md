# Microsoft 365 usage analytics data model

## Data for the Microsoft 365 usage analytics tables

The Microsoft 365 usage analytics data model connects to an API that exposes multidimensional data about service usage and adoption. The APIs that Microsoft 365 usage analytics uses to generate its data come from various generally available Graph APIs. The Microsoft 365 usage analytics API itself isn't generally available.

Note

For more information, see [Working with Microsoft 365 usage reports in Microsoft Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/report).

This API provides information about the monthly trend of usage of the various Microsoft 365 services. For the exact data returned by the API, see the table in the following section.
