# Adoption Score Organizational Messages in Microsoft 365

IT admins can use organizational messages to deliver clear, actionable messages in-product and in a targeted way, while maintaining user-level privacy. Adoption Score organizational messages use targeted in-product notifications to advise on Microsoft 365 recommended practices based on Adoption Score insights. Send users the following types of messages:

- Reminders to use products that you recently deployed.
- Encouragement to try a product on a different surface.
- Recommendations of new ways of working, such as using **@mentions** to improve response rates in communications.

Templated messages are delivered to users in their flow of work through surfaces including Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Word, and Microsoft Teams. Authorized professionals can use the organizational messages wizard in Adoption Score to:

- Choose from up to three templated message types.
- Define when and how often a message can be displayed.
- Exclude groups or priority accounts from receiving the message.

Organizational messages for Adoption Score initially roll out to **Communication**, **Content Collaboration**, and **Mobility** with more to follow to support all People Experience categories.

## Organizational Messages in Microsoft Intune

Organizational messages in Microsoft Intune enable organizations to deliver branded personalized messages to their users via native Windows 11 surfaces, such as **Notification Center** and the **Get started** app. These messages help people ramp up in new roles quicker, learn more about their organization, and stay informed of new updates and trainings. For more information, see [Create a policy that allows organizational messages in Microsoft Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/misc/organizational-messages-microsoft-365#create-a-policy-that-allows-organizational-messages-in-microsoft-intune).

## Frequently asked questions \(FAQs\)

### Why does the total number of messages seen differ from the expected number?

For any given message, not every user selected as message recipients receives the message. This behavior is expected because the message delivery depends on other factors that affect a message's reach, including:

- **User behavior**: Some delivery channels require the user to go to a specific location or app to have a chance to see the message. For example, a Microsoft 365 app call-out message can only be delivered to a user who opens the Microsoft 365 app.
- **System protections to prevent over-messaging and user dissatisfaction**: Some communication channels have message frequency limits if too many messages are live at a given time. For example, a Teaching call-out doesn't appear more than twice to each user.

### How can I test the messages before sending them to users of my entire company?

Send messages to specific Microsoft Entra groups, such as your IT department. For more information, see the [Create an organizational message](#create-an-organizational-message) section in this article.

### What is the recommended time frame window for the messages?

As the frequency of the messages is at most once a week, the recommended minimum duration is one month. The recommended length of the time window is 12 months. The recipient's list is refreshed daily. Your messages are always sent to users who didn't adopt the recommended practices in the last 28 days. Messages aren't repeatedly sent to users who already adopted.

### Can I customize the text in the messages?

Not currently, but additional customization options will be enabled in future releases.
