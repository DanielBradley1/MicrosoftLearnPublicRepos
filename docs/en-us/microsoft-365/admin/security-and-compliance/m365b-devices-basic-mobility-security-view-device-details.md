# View device details in Basic Mobility and Security

In Basic Mobility and Security in Microsoft 365 for Business Basic and Business Standard, you can use the **Active devices** page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or [Microsoft Graph PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/overview) to get details about the devices in your organization.

For more information about Basic Mobility and Security, see [Overview of Basic Mobility and Security in Microsoft 365 for business](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/m365b-devices-basic-mobility-security-overview?view=o365-worldwide).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You open the **Active devices** page for Basic Mobility and Security at [https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/IntuneDevices/?isMifo=true](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/IntuneDevices/?isMifo=true).
- If you haven't already, install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK by running the following command in an elevated PowerShell window \(a PowerShell window you open by selecting **Run as administrator**\):

  ```powershell
  Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope AllUsers
  ```


  Answer yes to any directives about installing the NuGet provider or installing from the PSGallery.

- To run the upcoming script, the PowerShell execution policy on your computer needs to be set to RemoteSigned \(it isn't by default\). For instructions, see [Set the PowerShell execution policy to RemoteSigned](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell-v2#set-the-powershell-execution-policy-to-remotesigned).
- You need to be assigned permissions before you can do the procedures in this article. You have the following options:

  - [Microsoft Entra permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/manage-roles-portal): Membership in the **Global Administrator**<sup>\*</sup> or **Directory Readers** roles gives users the required permissions *and* permissions for other features in Microsoft 365.

    Important

    \<sup>\*</sup> Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. Using lower permissioned accounts helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

- You can't use a delegated admin account to manage Basic Mobility and Security. For more information about delegated administration, see [Partners: Offer delegated administration](https://support.microsoft.com/office/partners-offer-delegated-administration-26530dc0-ebba-415b-86b1-b55bc06b073e).

## Use Microsoft Graph PowerShell to view device details

Device cmdlets in Microsoft Graph PowerShell show the enrollment and compliance status of recognized devices:

- *isManaged* property:

  - **True**: The device is enrolled in Basic Mobility and Security.
  - **False**: The device isn't enrolled in Basic Mobility and Security.

- *isCompliant* property:

  - **True**: The device is compliant with the [settings of the applicable policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/m365b-devices-basic-mobility-security-overview?view=o365-worldwide#policy-settings-in-basic-mobility-and-security) in Basic Mobility and Security.
  - **False**: The device isn't compliant with the settings of the applicable policy in Basic Mobility and Security.

This information is illustrated in the following diagram:

[![Diagram showing the device enrollment and device compliance states in Basic Mobility and Security.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/media/basic-mobility-security-device-info.png?view=o365-worldwide)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/media/basic-mobility-security-device-info.png?view=o365-worldwide#lightbox)

### Use the Get-MgDevice cmdlet to view device details

1. Open a PowerShell window and connect to your Microsoft 365 organization in Microsoft Graph by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Connect-MgGraph -Scopes Device.Read.All,User.Read.All
   ```


   For more information about connecting, see [Sign in to Microsoft Graph PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/get-started#sign-in).

2. Run the following command:

   ```powershell
   Get-MgDevice -All -ExpandProperty "registeredOwners" | Where-Object {($_.RegisteredOwners -ne $null) -and ($_.RegisteredOwners.Count -gt 0)}
   ```

Depending on the width of your screen, the width of the PowerShell window, and the font size in the PowerShell window, the following information is shown:

- DeletedDateTime
- Id
- AccountEnabled
- ApproximateLastSignInDateTime
- ComplianceExpirationDateTime
- DeviceId
- DeviceMetadata
- DeviceVersion
- DisplayName
- IsCompliant
- IsManaged

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-MgDevice](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.identity.directorymanagement/get-mgdevice).

### Create a PowerShell script to get device details

1. Copy the following text into Notepad and save it as `Get-MgGraphDeviceOwnership.ps1` \(a PowerShell script file\) in a place that's easy to find. For example, save the file to the C:\\My Documents folder.

   ```powershell
   param (
       [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)]
       [PSObject[]]$Users = @(),
       [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)]
       [Switch]$Export,
       [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)]
       [String]$ExportFileName = "UserDeviceOwnership_" + (Get-Date -Format "yyMMdd_HHMMss") + ".csv",
       [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)]
       [String]$ExportPath = [Environment]::GetFolderPath("Desktop")
   )

   #Clearing the screen
   Clear-Host

   #Preparing the output object
   $deviceOwnership = @()


   if ($users.Count -eq 0) {
       Write-Output "No user has been provided, gathering data for all devices in the tenant"
       #Getting all Devices and their registered owners
       $devices = Get-MgDevice -All -Property * -ExpandProperty registeredOwners

       #For each device which has a registered owner, extract the device data and the registered owner data
       foreach ($device in $devices) {
           $DeviceOwners = $device | Select-Object -ExpandProperty 'RegisteredOwners'
           #Checking if the DeviceOwners Object is empty
           if ($DeviceOwners -ne $null) {
               foreach ($DeviceOwner in $DeviceOwners) {
                   $OwnerDictionary = $DeviceOwner.AdditionalProperties
                   $OwnerDisplayName = $OwnerDictionary.Item('displayName')
                   $OwnerUPN = $OwnerDictionary.Item('userPrincipalName')
                   $OwnerID = $deviceOwner.Id
                   $deviceOwnership += [PSCustomObject]@{
                       DeviceDisplayName             = $device.DisplayName
                       DeviceId                      = $device.DeviceId
                       DeviceOSType                  = $device.OperatingSystem
                       DeviceOSVersion               = $device.OperatingSystemVersion
                       DeviceTrustLevel              = $device.TrustType
                       DeviceIsCompliant             = $device.IsCompliant
                       DeviceIsManaged               = $device.IsManaged
                       DeviceObjectId                = $device.Id
                       DeviceOwnerID                 = $OwnerID
                       DeviceOwnerDisplayName        = $OwnerDisplayName
                       DeviceOwnerUPN                = $OwnerUPN
                       ApproximateLastLogonTimestamp = $device.ApproximateLastSignInDateTime
                   }
               }
           }

       }
   }

   else {
       #Checking that userid is present in the users object
       Write-Output "List of users has been provided, gathering data for all devices owned by the provided users"
       foreach ($user in $users) {
           $devices = Get-MgUserOwnedDevice -UserId $user.Id -Property *
           foreach ($device in $devices) {
               $DeviceHashTable = $device.AdditionalProperties
               $deviceOwnership += [PSCustomObject]@{
                   DeviceId                      = $DeviceHashTable.Item('deviceId')
                   DeviceOSType                  = $DeviceHashTable.Item('operatingSystem')
                   DeviceOSVersion               = $DeviceHashTable.Item('operatingSystemVersion')
                   DeviceTrustLevel              = $DeviceHashTable.Item('trustType')
                   DeviceDisplayName             = $DeviceHashTable.Item('displayName')
                   DeviceIsCompliant             = if ($DeviceHashTable.ContainsKey('isCompliant')) {$DeviceHashTable.Item('isCompliant')} else {$null}
                   DeviceIsManaged               = if ($DeviceHashTable.ContainsKey('isManaged')) {$DeviceHashTable.Item('isManaged')} else {$null}
                   DeviceObjectId                = $device.Id
                   DeviceOwnerUPN                = $user.UserPrincipalName
                   DeviceOwnerID                 = $user.Id
                   DeviceOwnerDisplayName        = $user.DisplayName
                   ApproximateLastLogonTimestamp = $DeviceHashTable.Item('approximateLastSignInDateTime')
               }
           }
       }

   }

   $deviceOwnership

   if ($export) {
       $exportFile = Join-Path -Path $exportPath -ChildPath $exportFileName
       $deviceOwnership | Export-Csv -Path $exportFile -NoTypeInformation
       Write-Output "Data has been exported to $exportFile"
   }
   ```

2. Open a PowerShell window and connect to your Microsoft 365 organization in Microsoft Graph by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Connect-MgGraph -Scopes Device.Read.All,User.Read.All
   ```


   For more information about connecting, see [Sign in to Microsoft Graph PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/get-started#sign-in).

3. Use the following syntax to run the script:

   ```powershell
   & <path to script>\Get-MgGraphDeviceOwnership.ps1 [-Users <UserIds>] [-Export] [-ExportPath "<File path>"] [-ExportFileName "<FileName>"]
   ```


   - If you don't use the *Users* parameter the script returns information about all devices in the organization. The upcoming examples show how to use the *Users* parameter for individual users or group members.
   - The *Export* switch exports the results of the script to a CSV file. If you don't use the *ExportPath* or *ExportFileName* parameters, the default path is the Desktop folder, and the default filename is `UserDeviceOwnership_<Date>_<Time>.csv`.
   - If you go to the folder where the script is located \(for example, run the command `cd C:\My Documents` in the PowerShell window\), you can replace `& C:\My Documents\` with `.\` in all commands when you run the script.

This example returns device details for the specified user.

```powershell
& C:\My Documents\Get-MgGraphDeviceOwnership.ps1 -Users (Get-MgUser -UserId "laura@contoso.com")
```

This example returns device details for users in the FinanceStaff security group and exports the results to the specified file and location.

```powershell
$groupId = Get-MgGroup -Filter "displayName eq 'FinanceStaff'" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Id

$Users = Get-MgGroupMember -GroupId $groupId | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Id | ForEach-Object {Get-MgUser -UserId $_}

& C:\My Documents\Get-MgGraphDeviceOwnership.ps1 -User $Users -Export -ExportPath "C:\My Documents" -ExportFileName "Contoso FinanceStaff Devices 2024-12-19.csv"
```
