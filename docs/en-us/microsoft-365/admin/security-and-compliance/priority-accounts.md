# Manage and monitor priority accounts

Every Microsoft 365 organization contains essential users like executives, leaders, managers, administrators, or others who have access to sensitive, proprietary, or high priority information, or who are influential in your organization. You can designate up to 250 of these users as *priority accounts* and \(depending on your subscription\) use app-specific features that give them extra protection, visibility, and priority.

This article describes how to tag users and groups as priority accounts, and the extra protections, visibility, and priority they receive.

Tip

For security best practices for high value accounts, see [Security recommendations for priority accounts in cloud organizations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/priority-accounts-security-recommendations).

## Benefits of priority accounts

Tagging a user as a priority account enables the following features for that user. Availability depends on your subscription and, for the Exchange Online features, on the size of your organization.

| Feature | Description | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reporting in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 | Filter alerts, reports, and investigations to priority accounts. | Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or Plan 2 |
| Priority account protection | Applies other heuristics that are specifically tailored to company executives. Turned on by default. | Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 |
| Exchange Online priority account monitoring | Shows mailbox health for scenarios like licensing, mailbox storage, message limits, and mail delivery. | At least 5,000 qualifying licenses **and** at least 50 monthly active users. For more information, see [Monitor priority accounts](#monitor-priority-accounts). |
| Premium Mail Flow Monitoring | Alerts you when failed or delayed email exceeds a threshold. You configure the threshold and the alerts. | At least 5,000 qualifying licenses **and** at least 50 monthly active users. For more information, see [Monitor priority accounts](#monitor-priority-accounts). |
| Priority feedback in Copilot Chat | Feedback is flagged and moved to the front of the triage queue to ensure your most important users are heard first. | Allow users to submit feedback and include log files and relevant content samples. For more information, see [Manage Microsoft feedback for your organization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/privacy/microsoft-365/feedback/feedback-manage). |

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- The maximum number of priority accounts is 250.
- You need to be assigned permissions before you can do the procedures in this article. You have the following options:

  - [Microsoft Defender XDR Unified role based access control \(RBAC\)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/manage-rbac) \(If **Email & collaboration** > **Defender for Office 365** permissions is ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/media/scc-toggle-on.png?view=o365-worldwide) **Active**. Affects the Defender portal only, not PowerShell\): **Authorization and settings/System settings/manage** or **Authorization and settings/System settings/Read-only**.
  - [Email & collaboration permissions in the Microsoft Defender portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/scc-permissions):

    - *Apply and remove the Priority account tag from users*: Membership in the **Security Administrator** and **Exchange Admin** role groups.

  - [Microsoft Entra permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/manage-roles-portal): Membership in the **Global Administrator**<sup>\*</sup> or **Security Administrator** roles gives users the required permissions *and* permissions for other features in Microsoft 365.

Important

<sup>\*</sup> Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. Using lower permissioned accounts helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that you should limit to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

## Manage priority accounts

You can manage priority accounts in the Microsoft 365 admin center, Microsoft Defender portal, or by using PowerShell.

### Manage priority accounts in the Microsoft admin center

1. In the Microsoft admin center at [https://admin.cloud.microsoft](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339), go to the **Priority accounts** page at [https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/priorityaccounts](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/priorityaccounts).

   If you prefer the long way, go to **Users** > **Active users** > on the **Active users** page, select ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/media/m365-cc-sc-more-actions-icon.png?view=o365-worldwide) **More actions** > ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/media/m365-cc-sc-medal.png?view=o365-worldwide) **Manage priority accounts**.
2. On the **Priority accounts** page, take either of the following actions:

   - **Add members**:

     1. Select ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png?view=o365-worldwide) **Tag accounts**. In the **Tag user accounts as priority** flyout that opens, select one of the following values in **How would you like to search for accounts?**:

   When you're finished on the **New tag created** page, select **Done**.

   Tip

   It can take up to eight hours to completely apply tags.

### Manage priority accounts in PowerShell

To manage priority accounts in [Exchange Online PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell), use the following commands:

- To view the list of priority accounts, run the following command:

  ```powershell
  Get-User -IsVIP | Select-Object Identity
  ```

- To add a user to the list of priority accounts, replace `<Identity>` with the user's email address, and then run the following command:

  ```powershell
  Set-User -VIP $true -Identity <Identity> -Confirm:$false
  ```

- To remove a user from the list of priority accounts, replace `<Identity>` with the user's email address, and then run the following command:

  ```powershell
  Set-User -VIP $false -Identity <Identity> -Confirm:$false
  ```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-User](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/get-user) and [Set-User](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/set-user).

## Monitor priority accounts

After you tag users or groups as priority accounts, they get the following protections and visibility in Microsoft 365:

- **Visibility in reporting in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or Plan 2**: Microsoft 365 Business Premium and other subscriptions that include Defender for Office 365 \(for example, Microsoft 365 E5 or an add-on subscription\) support priority accounts as tags in filters in alerts, reports, and investigations. For more information, see [User tags in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/user-tags-about?view=o365-worldwide).
- **Priority account protection in Defender for Office 365 Plan 2**: A natural question is, "Aren't all users a priority? Why not designate all users as priority accounts for priority account protection?" Yes, all users are a priority, but priority account protection in Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 \(for example, in Business Premium with the [Microsoft Defender Suite for Business Premium add-on](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/add-defender-suite-business-premium?view=o365-worldwide)\) offers the following benefits:

  - **Other heuristics**: Our analysis of mail flow in the Microsoft datacenters indicates that mail flow patterns for company executives are different than the average user. Priority account protection offers other heuristics specifically tailored to company executives that don't benefit regular users.
  - **Extra visibility in reporting**: Priority account protection as a filter allows you to specifically target your investigations.


  For more information, see [Configure and review priority account protection in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/priority-accounts-turn-on-priority-account-protection).


  Tip


  When you apply priority account protection to a mailbox, you should also apply priority account protection to users with access to the mailbox. For example, the CEO and their executive assistant.

- **Email monitoring in Exchange Online**: Email monitoring features for priority accounts have the following requirements:

  - At least 5,000 licenses in any combination of the following products:

    - Office 365 E3
    - Microsoft 365 E3
    - Office 365 E5
    - Microsoft 365 E5


    For example, your organization has 3,000 Office 365 E3 licenses and 2,500 Microsoft 365 E5 licenses, for a total of 5,500 licenses from the qualifying products.

  - At least 50 monthly active users for one or more core workloads:

    - Microsoft Teams
    - OneDrive
    - SharePoint
    - Exchange Online
    - Microsoft 365 productivity apps


  If your organization meets **both of these requirements**, you can use the following email monitoring features for priority accounts:


  - **Exchange Online priority account monitoring**: You can view health of priority accounts for scenarios like Exchange licensing, mailbox storage, message limit, and mail delivery. For more information, see [Priority accounts monitoring scenarios](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-exchange-monitoring#priority-accounts-monitoring-scenarios).
  - **Premium Mail Flow Monitoring**: Healthy mail flow can be critical to business success, and delivery delays or failures can have a negative effect on the business. You can choose a threshold for failed or delayed emails, receive alerts when that threshold is exceeded, and view a report of email issues for priority accounts. For more information, see [Email issues for priority accounts report in the new EAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/monitoring/mail-flow-reports/mfr-email-issues-for-priority-accounts-report).
