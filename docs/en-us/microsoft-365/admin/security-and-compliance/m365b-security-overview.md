## Account security

All subscriptions in Microsoft 365 for business include Microsoft Entra ID Free, which includes the feature named *security defaults*. Because security defaults is on by default, multifactor authentication \(MFA\) is enabled by default in Microsoft 365 for business organizations.

Business Premium also includes Microsoft Entra ID P1, which includes the feature named *Conditional Access*. Conditional Access uses granular policies based on Zero Trust architecture to give users access to resources. If your organization requires increased or complex security settings, you can use Conditional Access policies instead of security defaults.

For information about security defaults and conditional access, see [Multifactor authentication in Microsoft 365 for business](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/multi-factor-authentication-microsoft-365?view=o365-worldwide).

For other considerations for administrator or admin accounts, see [Admin account security in Microsoft 365 for business](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/m365b-account-security-admins?view=o365-worldwide)

## Email and collaboration security

All subscriptions in Microsoft 365 for business include the built-in security features for all cloud mailboxes against malware, spam, and phishing \(spoofing\) in email. For more information, see [Overview of the built-in security features for all cloud mailboxes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/eop-about).

The built-in security features for all cloud mailboxes include the following types of threat policies that are on by default:

- [Anti-malware policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-malware-protection-about#anti-malware-policies)
- [Anti-spam policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-spam-protection-about#anti-spam-policies)
- [Spoofing protection in anti-phishing policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-phishing-policies-about)

Microsoft 365 Business Premium also includes Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1, which adds the following types of protection:

- [Impersonation protection and phishing email thresholds in anti-phishing policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-phishing-policies-about#exclusive-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365)
- [Safe Attachments policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/safe-attachments-about)
- [Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-about)
- [Safe Links policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/safe-links-about)

The default settings for these email and collaboration protection features provide a good level of protection. But for even better protection, we recommend configuring more settings and features for the best available protection \(for example, [turn on and assign the Standard and/or Strict preset security policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/preset-security-policies#use-the-microsoft-defender-portal-to-assign-standard-and-strict-preset-security-policies-to-users)\).

For more information, see [Email and collaboration security in Microsoft 365 for business](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/m365b-email-collaboration-security?view=o365-worldwide).

Tip

For a deeper dive into default policies vs. custom policies vs. preset security policies, see [Configure threat policies in Defender for Office 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/mdo-deployment-guide#step-2-configure-threat-policies).

The security settings in default policies, the Standard preset security policy, and the Strict preset security policy are listed in the tables in [Recommended email and collaboration threat policy settings for cloud organizations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365).

## Device security

All subscriptions in Microsoft 365 for business include *Basic Mobility and Security*, which is a [limited subset of Microsoft Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/m365b-devices-basic-mobility-security-overview?view=o365-worldwide#comparison-of-basic-mobility-and-security-and-microsoft-intune). Basic Mobility and Security is a mobile device management \(MDM\) solution that helps you secure access to company data on enrolled devices in supported apps.

  - Support for mobile device management \(MDM\) and mobile application management \(MAM\) strategies. In MDM, the company manages the whole device. In MAM, the company manages *company data* on the device \(which is an option for personal devices, also known as bring your own device or BYOD\).
