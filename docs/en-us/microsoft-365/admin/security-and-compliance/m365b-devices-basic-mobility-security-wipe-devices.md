# Wipe devices in Basic Mobility and Security

Mobile devices can store sensitive organizational information and provide access to your organization's Microsoft 365 resources. Admins can remotely remove company data from devices that are [enrolled in Basic Mobility and Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/m365b-devices-basic-mobility-security-enroll-devices?view=o365-worldwide). The following actions are available:

- **Factory reset**: Delete all data on the device, including all installed apps, photos, and personal information. This action returns the device to factory default settings. Typically, you use this action on company owned devices. For example:

  - Lost or stolen devices.
  - Reassigned devices before you reassign them.

- **Remove company data**: Remove only organization data from the device. Personal data, photos, and apps aren't affected. Typically, you use this action on personal devices when a user leaves the company. Removing company data has the following effects based on the device platform:

  - Policy settings applied by Basic Mobility and Security are no longer enforced; users can change the device settings. Applies to:

    - iOS/iPadOS
    - Android

  - Email profiles created by Basic Mobility and Security are removed and cached email is deleted. Applies to:

    - iOS/iPadOS


    Tip


    The **Require managing email profile** \(*RequireEmailProfile*\) setting is required in the applicable policy to remove company data.

- **Delete**: Remove the device from management by Basic Mobility and Security. The result is equivalent to **Remove company data**.

Regardless of your selection, the request is immediately sent to the device:

- The device is marked as not compliant in Microsoft Entra ID.
- The device is removed from the list of managed devices on the **Fully managed** tab of the **Active devices** page in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- You open the **Active devices** page for Basic Mobility and Security at [https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/IntuneDevices/?isMifo=true](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/IntuneDevices/?isMifo=true).
- You need to be assigned permissions before you can do the procedures in this article. You have the following options:

  - [Microsoft Entra permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/manage-roles-portal): Membership in the **Global Administrator**<sup>\*</sup> or **Cloud Device Administrator** roles gives users the required permissions *and* permissions for other features in Microsoft 365.

    Important

    \<sup>\*</sup> Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. Using lower permissioned accounts helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

- You can't use a delegated admin account to manage Basic Mobility and Security. For more information about delegated administration, see [Partners: Offer delegated administration](https://support.microsoft.com/office/partners-offer-delegated-administration-26530dc0-ebba-415b-86b1-b55bc06b073e).
