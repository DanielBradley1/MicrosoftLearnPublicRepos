# Manage add-ins in the Microsoft 365 admin center

Tip

The [integrated apps portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/test-and-deploy-microsoft-365-apps?view=o365-worldwide) is the recommended and most feature-rich way for most customers to centrally deploy Office add-ins to users and groups within your organization.

Office Add-ins, also known as Integrated Apps, help users in your organization to personalize documents and streamline access to information on the web. An admin can centrally manage add-ins that are deployed to users and groups via the Microsoft 365 admin center. For example, an admin can:

- Enable or disable add-ins.
- Change which users or groups have access to add-ins.
- Remove add-ins that are no longer used.

For more information about installing add-ins from the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [Deploy Office Add-ins in the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide).

## Add-in states in the Microsoft 365 admin center

An add-in can be in one of the following states:

| State | How the state occurs | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enabled** | Admin downloads the add-in in the Microsoft 365 admin center and assigns it to users or groups. | Users and groups assigned the add-in have access to the add-in. |
| **Not assigned** | Admin downloads the add-in in the Microsoft 365 admin center but the add-in isn't assigned to a user or group. | Unassigned users and groups can't access the add-in. |
| **Removed** | Admin removes the add-in from the Microsoft 365 admin center. | No users can access the add-in. |

Choosing not to assign an add-in versus removing it might make sense if the add-in is only used during specific times of the year. If no one is using an add-in anymore, consider removing the add-in from the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Remove an add-in from the Microsoft 365 admin center

To remove an add-in that you deployed and no longer need, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339).
2. From the left navigation bar, select **... Show all**, and then select **Settings** to expand it.
3. Under **Settings**, select **Integrated apps**.

6. In the **Remove apps** window, select **Yes, I'm sure I want to remove the app and associated data**, and then select **Remove**.

## Edit user access to an add-in in the Microsoft 365 admin center

After you deploy an add-in, you can manage user access to the add-in. To manage user access to an add-in, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339).

## Manage add-in downloads by enabling or disabling Microsoft Marketplace

Important

In the Microsoft 365 admin center, **Microsoft Marketplace** is sometimes referred to as **Office Store**.

As an admin, you can manage access to the Microsoft Marketplace and control whether users can download add-ins. Managing access to the Microsoft Marketplace is important for the following reasons:

- Ensure users can download Office Add-ins and take advantage of their features.
- Ensure users can access only add-ins approved through centralized deployment.

Use this setting if you want to:

- Allow users to discover and install approved add-ins themselves.
- Block all user-initiated add-in downloads and rely only on centralized deployment.

### Enable or disable access to the Microsoft Marketplace for all apps

The **Let users access the Office Store** setting in the Microsoft 365 admin center controls all users' ability to acquire the following add-ins from Microsoft Marketplace:

- Add-ins for non-subscription Word, Excel, and PowerPoint on Windows and Mac
- Add-ins for subscription Microsoft 365

When you disable access to the Microsoft Marketplace, a user who tries to access it sees the following message:

**Office store not available. Unfortunately, your organization has disabled access to the Office Store. Please contact your administrator to get access to the store.**

Support for enabling or disabling access to the Microsoft Marketplace starts in the following versions:

- Office on Windows: 16.0.9001.
- Office on Mac: 16.10.18011401.
- Office on iOS: 2.9.18010804.
- Office for the web.

To enable or disable access to the Microsoft Marketplace and downloading of add-ins via the **Let users access the Office Store** setting, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339).
2. From the left navigation bar, select **... Show all**, and then select **Settings** to expand it.
3. Under **Settings**, select [Org settings](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2053743).
4. In the **Org settings** page, make sure **Services** is selected, and then select **User owned apps and services**.
5. In the **User owned apps and services** pane:

   - Select **Let users access the Office Store** to give users access to the Microsoft Marketplace and allow users to download. This setting is the default setting.
   - Clear **Let users access the Office Store** to block users from accessing the Microsoft Marketplace and prevent users from downloading add-ins.

6. Select **Save** after you choose the desired setting. If the setting is already in the desired state, select the **X** in the top-right corner to cancel.

### Important limitations and exceptions

- Access to the Microsoft Marketplace doesn't apply to Microsoft Outlook add-ins. To manage Microsoft Outlook add-ins, see [Specify the administrators and users who can install and manage add-ins for Outlook in Exchange Online](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/add-ins-for-outlook/specify-who-can-install-and-manage-add-ins).
- Even if users can download add-ins from Microsoft Marketplace, they can't launch or use the add-in in the client.
- To prevent a user from signing into the Microsoft Marketplace by using a personal Microsoft account, restrict sign in to use only an organizational account. For more information, see [Identity, authentication, and authorization in Office 2016](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/security/identity-authentication-and-authorization-in-office).
- If you prevent users from accessing Microsoft Marketplace, they also can't [Sideload Office Add-ins for testing from a network share](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/create-a-network-shared-folder-catalog-for-task-pane-and-content-add-ins).

#### User owned apps and services settings for educational tenants

Additional access options are available for educational tenants in the **User owned apps and services** pane. You can control access based on whether a user is:

- A faculty, staff, and other non-student users.
- An adult student.
- A non-adult student.

[![Screenshot of the user-owned apps and services settings for educational tenants in the Microsoft 365 admin center.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/media/user-owned-apps-and-services-edu.png?view=o365-worldwide)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/media/user-owned-apps-and-services-edu.png?view=o365-worldwide#lightbox)

The user's license information defines the type of user.

- A faculty, staff, and other non-student users: A user who doesn't have an educational license.
- An adult or non-adult student: A user who has an educational license. The **Age Group** property checks whether the student is an adult.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Assign or unassign licenses for users in the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users?view=o365-worldwide).

## End-user experience with add-ins in Office applications

After you deploy an add-in, users interact with the add-in directly in their Office apps. An add-in appears on all platforms that the add-in supports. For more information, see [Start using your Office Add-in](https://support.microsoft.com/office/82e665c4-6700-4b56-a3f3-ef5441996862).

Some add-ins support commands that appear in the ribbon. For example, the **Citations** add-in shows the command **Search Citation** in the ribbon:

[![Screenshot of the Microsoft 365 ribbon showing the Search Citations add-in command.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/media/553b0c0a-65e9-4746-b3b0-8c1b81715a86.png?view=o365-worldwide)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/media/553b0c0a-65e9-4746-b3b0-8c1b81715a86.png?view=o365-worldwide#lightbox)

If an add-in doesn't support commands that appear in the ribbon, the user can view the add-in via **Manage your apps**. They can also view all add-ins that are deployed in the organization in **Manage your apps**.
