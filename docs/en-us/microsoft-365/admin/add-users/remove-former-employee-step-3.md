# Step 3 - Wipe and block a former employee's mobile device

If an employee has left your organization and they had a business phone, you can use the [Exchange admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2059104) to wipe and block that device. This action helps ensure that your business data is removed from the device and it can no longer connect to your organization's Microsoft 365 subscription.

If your organization uses Basic Mobility and Security to manage mobile devices, you can wipe and block those devices [using Basic Mobility and Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/m365b-devices-basic-mobility-security-wipe-devices).

Note

You must have appropriate permissions through a an appropriate role, such as the [Directory Writers role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#directory-writers) to perform the tasks in this article.
