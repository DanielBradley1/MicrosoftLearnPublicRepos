# Give mailbox permissions to another Microsoft 365 user - Admin help

As an administrator, you might have company requirements to allow some users to have access to another user's mailbox. For example, you might want to enable an assistant to send or read email from their manager's mailbox. Or you might want to give one of your users the ability to send email on behalf of another user. This article describes how to set up mailbox permissions, access another user's mailbox, and send email on behalf of another user.

If you're looking for information about creating and managing shared mailboxes, check out [Create a shared mailbox](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/email/create-a-shared-mailbox?view=o365-worldwide).

And if you're an end user who wants to grant email and calendar access to someone else, see [About delegates: Allow someone to manage your mail and calendar in Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/about-delegates-allow-someone-to-manage-your-mail-and-calendar-in-outlook-41c40c04-3bd1-4d22-963a-28eafec25926).

## Set up mailbox permissions

The first step to setting up permissions is deciding which actions you want to allow the other user to take in the given mailbox. You can allow a user to read email messages from the mailbox, send email messages on behalf of another user, or send email messages as if they were sent from that mailbox. Permissions can only be set up within the current organization. It's not possible to set up mailbox permissions for users in another organization.

Note

Once permissions are set, it can take up to 60 minutes for the changes to propagate through the system and be in effect.

## Access another person's mailbox

After permissions are set and access is granted, users have a few different options to access a mailbox. See [Share and access another person's mailbox or folder in Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/share-and-access-another-person-s-mailbox-or-folder-in-outlook-a909ad30-e413-40b5-a487-0ea70b763081).

## Send email from another user's mailbox

2. Select the name of the user \(from whom you plan to give a sending permission\) to open their properties pane.
3. On the **Mail** tab, select **Send as permissions**.
4. Select **Add permissions**, then choose the name of the person who you want this user to be able to send as.

3. Next to **Send as**, select **Edit**.
4. Select **Add permissions**, then choose the name of the person who you want this user to be able to send as.

## Read email in another user's mailbox

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Users** > [Active users](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822).
2. Select a user \(whose mailbox you want to allow to be read\) to open their properties pane.
3. On the **Mail** tab, select **Read and manage permissions**.
4. Select **Add permissions**, then choose the name of the user or users that you want to allow to read email from this mailbox.

Note

**Read** and **Manage** permissions are called **Full Access** permission when granted in the [Exchange admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2059104). This permission allows the assigned user mailbox to read and manage emails in the user mailbox on which the permission is assigned. Full Access permission doesn't grant **Send as** or **Send on behalf** permissions.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go **Users** > [Active users](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850628).
2. Select a user, expand **Mail Settings**, and then select **Edit** next to **Mailbox permissions**.
3. Next to **Read and manage**, select **Edit**.
4. Select **Add permissions**, then choose the name of the user or users that you want to allow to read email from this mailbox.
5. Select **Add**.

## Send email on behalf of another user

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Users** > [Active users](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822).
2. Select the name of the user \(from whom you plan to give a **Send on behalf** permission\) to open their properties pane.
3. On the **Mail** tab, select **Send on behalf of permissions**.
4. Select **Add permissions**, then choose the name of the user or users that you want to allow to send email on behalf of this mailbox.
5. Select **Add**.

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Users** > [Active users](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822).
2. Select a user, expand **Mail Settings**, and then select **Edit** next to **Mailbox permissions**.
3. Next to **Send on behalf**, select **Edit**.
4. Select **Add permissions**, then choose the name of the user or users that you want to allow to send email on behalf of this mailbox.
5. Select **Add**.

Note

The **Send As** and **Send on Behalf** permissions don't work in Outlook Desktop client with the `HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled` parameter on the mailbox set to `True`, because those permissions require the mailbox to be visible in Outlook via the Global Address List.
