# Guests in the Microsoft 365 admin center

By default, guest access for Microsoft 365 Groups is turned on for your organization. Admins can control whether to allow guest access to groups for their whole organization or for individual groups.

Any guests you add to your Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, or Microsoft Entra External ID are also added to the **`Guest users`** list in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/). Guests can attend meetings, view documents, and chat in Teams they're invited to. Once a user shows up in the **`Guest users`** list, you can remove their access there.

To view guests, in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/), in the left nav, expand **Users**, and then choose **`Guest users`**.

## Before you begin

To add a guest, you need to have a role that allows you to create users in your tenant directory. For example, at least a [Guest Inviter role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#guest-inviter) or a [User Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#user-administrator).

Important

Use roles with the fewest permissions. Lower permissioned accounts help improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role. Limit its use to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role. For more information, see [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

## Next steps: Add guests in Microsoft Entra External ID

To add guests in Microsoft Entra External ID, see [add a guest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal).

After you add a user, you can also assign them to a group or give them access to an app in your organization. When you add a user in the Microsoft Entra admin center, the user also appears on the **Guest users** page in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/).

To invite multiple guests to collaborate with your organization, see [add guests in bulk](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/tutorial-bulk-invite).
