# Restore a deleted Microsoft 365 group

If you delete a group, by default, it's retained for 30 days. This 30-day period is considered a "soft-delete" because you can still restore the group. After 30 days, the group and its associated contents are permanently deleted and can't be restored.

When a group is restored, the following content is restored:

- Microsoft Entra Microsoft 365 Groups object, properties, and members
- Group's e-mail addresses
- Exchange Online shared Inbox and calendar
- SharePoint Online team site and files
- OneNote notebook
- Planner
- Teams
- Viva Engage group and group content \(If the Microsoft 365 group was created from Viva Engage\)
- Power BI [Classic workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-create-workspaces)

Note

This article describes how to restore Microsoft 365 groups only.

## Restore a group

You can restore a group in Outlook, the Microsoft 365 admin center, or PowerShell.

### Restore a group in Outlook

If you're the owner of a Microsoft 365 group, you can restore the group yourself in Outlook on the web by following these steps:

1. In Outlook, on the [deleted groups page](https://outlook.office.com/people/group/deleted), select the **Manage groups** option under the **Groups** node, and then choose **Deleted**.
2. Select the **Restore** tab next to the group you want to restore.

If the deleted group doesn't appear here, contact an administrator.

### Restore a group in the Microsoft 365 admin center

If you're a groups administrator, you can restore a deleted group in the Microsoft 365 admin center:

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.cloud.microsoft/) and sign in.
2. Expand **Groups**, and then select **Deleted groups**.
3. Select the group that you want to restore, and then select **Restore group**.

### Restore a group by using PowerShell

To use PowerShell to restore a deleted group, see [Restore a deleted Microsoft 365 group or cloud security group in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/users/groups-restore-deleted#view-the-deleted-microsoft-365-groups-that-are-available-to-restore-by-using-powershell).

Note

1. In some cases, it can take as long as 24 hours for the group and all of its data to be restored.
2. After restoring a Microsoft 365 Group, wait at least one hour before sending email messages to the group. Messages sent immediately after restoration may fail with an NDR error message that says `550 5.1.10_ RESOLVER.ADR.RecipientNotFound`.
