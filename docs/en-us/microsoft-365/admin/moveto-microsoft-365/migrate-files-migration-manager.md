# Migrate Google files to Microsoft 365 for business with Migration Manager

Note

Note

Migration Manager will make a copy of the files and move the copies to Microsoft 365 for business. The original files will stay in Google Drives also.

## Before you start

All the users should have signed in to Microsoft 365 for business and set up their OneDrive. To do this, go to [office.com](https://office.com), sign in with your Microsoft 365 for business credentials, and then choose OneDrive.

Currently, Migration Manager isn't available for Google on any of the Government clouds.
