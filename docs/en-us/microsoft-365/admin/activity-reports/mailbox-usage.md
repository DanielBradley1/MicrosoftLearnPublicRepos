# Exchange Mailbox usage report

The Exchange Mailbox usage report provides information about users with a user mailbox and the level of activity by each user. Activity is based on the email send, read, create appointment, send meeting, accept meeting, decline meeting, and cancel meeting activity. The report provides information about how much storage each user mailbox consumes, and how many of them are approaching storage quotas. The mailbox usage report also contains information about mailboxes shared among users, providing storage and quota data on shared mailboxes.

For general information about usage reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center, and to see a list of all available reports, see [Microsoft 365 admin center usage reports overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/activity-reports?view=o365-worldwide).

## Interpret the Exchange Mailbox usage report

The report displays trends over the last 7, 30, 90, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table shows data for up to 28 days from the current date, not the date the report generated. The data in each report usually covers up to the last 24 to 48 hours.

You can view your organization's Exchange mailbox usage by looking at the **Mailbox**, **Storage**, and **Quota** charts.

To access shared mailbox information, change the drop-down selection at the top right of the charts to **Shared**. If your tenant doesn't have shared mailboxes, you can't view any shared mailbox information.

Note

You can't currently export the summary chart information for shared mailboxes. This known issue will be corrected in a future update.

### The Mailbox chart

The **Mailbox** chart shows the total number of user or shared mailboxes in your organization, and the total number of user mailboxes that are active on any given day of the reporting period. A user mailbox is active if it had an email activity that included at least one of the following actions:

- Send
- Read
- Create appointment
- Send meeting
- Accept meeting
- Decline meeting
- Cancel meeting activity

Note

Shared mailboxes don't have activity independent of a user mailbox, so the report shows only a count of shared mailboxes when you select this mailbox type.

On the **Mailbox** chart:

- The Y axis is the number of user or shared mailboxes.
- The X axis is the selected date range for this specific report.

### The Storage chart

The **Storage** chart shows the amount of storage used in your organization by mailbox type. The **Storage** chart doesn't include archive mailboxes. For more information about auto-expanding archiving, see [Overview of auto-expanding archiving in Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/autoexpanding-archiving?view=o365-worldwide).

On the **Storage** chart:

- The Y axis is the amount of storage used by user or shared mailboxes in your organization.
- The X axis is the selected date range for this specific report.

### The Quota chart

The **Quota** chart shows the number of user or shared mailboxes in each quota category. There are four quota categories:

- **Good**: The number of users or shared mailboxes whose storage used is below the "issue warning" quota.
- **Warning**: The number of users or shared mailboxes whose storage used is at or above the "issue warning" quota, but below the "prohibit send" quota.
- **Can't send**: The number of users or shared mailboxes whose storage used is at or above the "prohibit send" quota, but below the "prohibit send/receive" quota.
- **Can't send/receive**: The number of users or shared mailboxes whose storage used is at or above the "prohibit send/receive" quota.

On the **Quota** chart:

- The Y axis is the number of user or shared mailboxes in each storage quota.
- The X axis is the quota category.

Filter the charts you see by selecting an item in the legend.
