# Microsoft Teams Team usage report

The Microsoft Teams Team usage report provides an overview of the usage activity in Teams, including the number of active users, channels, and messages.

## Interpret the Microsoft Teams Team usage report

The report displays trends over the last 7, 30, 90, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table shows data for up to 28 days from the current date, not the date the report generated.

Note

Activity dates in this report are based on Coordinated Universal Time \(UTC\). Post counts attributed to a given day reflect messages sent between 12:00 AM and 11:59 PM UTC, which might differ from your organization's local time zone.

To ensure data quality, the system performs daily data validation checks for the past three days and fills any detected gaps. You might notice differences in historical data during the process.

Important

Data for a given day appears within 48 hours. For example, data for January 10th appears in the report by January 12th.
