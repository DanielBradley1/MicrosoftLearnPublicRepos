# Microsoft Copilot Agents usage report

The Microsoft Copilot Agent usage report helps you track how agents are used in Microsoft Copilot Chat and Microsoft 365 apps - Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. You can see which agents both licensed and unlicensed Microsoft Copilot users use across Declarative, SharePoint, and Custom engine agents. These agents include agents built by your organization, Microsoft, and Third-party.

You can view usage within an hour from when users interact with agents. The report includes key metrics such as:

- Total active users and agents
- Summary and daily time series
- Active usage per user, per agent, and per agent-user pair

For general information about usage reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center, and to see a list of all available reports, see [Microsoft 365 admin center usage reports overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/activity-reports?view=o365-worldwide).

## Interpret the Microsoft Copilot Agents usage report

Use the Agents usage report to see the usage of agents in your organization that your organization, Microsoft, or Third-party built. These agents include agents that an admin approves, and agents that users create through agent builder and share with users in your organization. Admins can manage agents in the same way as they manage any other app by using Copilot controls in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see [Manage agents for Microsoft Copilot in the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-copilot-agents-integrated-apps).

At the top of the report, you can filter by different periods. You can view the agent report over the last 7 or 30 days.

- **Total active users** shows how many unique users in your organization - whether they have a Microsoft Copilot license or not - used agents in Microsoft Copilot Chat during the selected time period. This count includes agents created by your organization, Microsoft, or Third-party.
- **Active users \(licensed\)** shows how many unique users in your organization who had a Microsoft Copilot license used agents in Microsoft Copilot Chat during the selected time period.
- **Active users \(unlicensed\)** shows how many unique users in your organization, who didn't have a Microsoft Copilot license and used agents in Microsoft Copilot Chat during the selected time period.
- **Total active agents** shows how many unique apps with an agent element in that app with at least one active user over the selected time period. This count includes agents created by your organization, including agents both admin approved and shared by users in your organization, Microsoft built agents, and agents built by Third-party.

An active user of an agent is a user who asks an agent a question and receives a response. Users interact with agents in the following ways:

- By selecting the agent from the side panel in Microsoft Copilot Chat and at-mentioning the agent in the chat experience.
- By selecting the **Open navigation panel** button in the top corner of Microsoft Copilot in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint.

To learn more about managing and enabling agents in your organization, see [Manage agents for Microsoft Copilot in the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-copilot-agents-integrated-apps).

To learn how to display this information in usage reports, see [Show user, group, or site details in usage reports](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/activity-reports?view=o365-worldwide#show-user-group-or-site-details-in-usage-reports).

## FAQ

### Why am I not seeing Cowork usage in the Copilot agent usage report?

Cowork usage is not included in the Copilot agent usage report because the report is designed to show usage and adoption of agents in Copilot. You can track adoption of Cowork separately in the [Cowork usage report](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/cowork-usage-report) in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

### Why does this report only show the past 7 and 30 days, while other usage reports also show the past 90 and 180 days?

The agent report doesn't yet include the past 90 and 180 days but will add this capability in a future update.

### What is "Last activity detected"?

Last activity detected shows the most recent date and timestamp \(in UTC\) when user activity generated agent usage.

### Are agents created from Microsoft Copilot Studio and Teams Toolkit included?

Yes. The following agents are the agents for which usage is reported:

- Agents created in Microsoft Copilot Studio by users in your organization and approved by an admin.
- Agents created in Teams Toolkit by users in your organization and approved by an admin.
- Agents created by users through [agent builder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/copilot-studio-agent-builder) for users that have this feature enabled and shared with other users in your organization.

### Why is the total active user count less than the sum of licensed and unlicensed active users?

The sum of active users without a license and active users with a license might exceed the total active users if you assigned or removed licenses during the selected timeframe.

### How can I view the username or display name if they're hidden?

By default, the usage report anonymizes the username and display name. Global administrators can change settings to reveal or conceal these values.

Important

Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. Using roles with the fewest permissions helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role. For more information, see [About administrator roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

To learn how to change the setting to show the username and display name information, see [Show user, group, or site details in usage reports](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/activity-reports?view=o365-worldwide#show-user-group-or-site-details-in-usage-reports).

### Are SharePoint agents used in Teams included in the usage report?

No. SharePoint agents used in Teams aren't currently included in the usage metrics in the report. For more information, see [Share an agent from SharePoint in Teams - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/office/share-an-agent-from-sharepoint-in-teams-6dcbf7b5-8c13-44e5-a68a-dbd71fb76ad3).

### Why is the "Total active users" count smaller than the sum of unlicensed and licensed user counts for my organization?

You might see this discrepancy if a user's Microsoft Copilot license changes during the selected time period. For example, the user might be assigned a Copilot license and later remove it within that same period.
