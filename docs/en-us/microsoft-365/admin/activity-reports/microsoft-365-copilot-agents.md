Use the Microsoft Copilot Agents report to see the usage of Copilot agents in your organization that your organization built. The report includes agents that an admin approves and agents that users create through agent builder and share with users in your organization. Admins can manage agents the same way they manage any other app in the Integrated apps section of the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see [Manage Copilot agents in Integrated Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-copilot-agents-integrated-apps).

At the top of the report, you can filter by different periods. You can view the Microsoft Copilot agent report over the last 7, 30, 90, or 180 days:

**Active agents** shows the distinct number of apps with a declarative agent element in that app with at least one active user over the selected time period. For more information, see [Declarative agents FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-copilot-agents-integrated-apps). As defined earlier in this article, only agents that your organization created, including both admin approved and shared by users in your organization, are included.

An active user of an agent is a user who asks an agent a question and receives a response. Users interact with agents in the following ways:

- By selecting the agent from the side panel in Microsoft Copilot Chat and at-mentioning the agent in the chat experience.
- By selecting the **Open navigation panel** button in the top corner of Microsoft Copilot in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint.

In **Recommendations**, the recommended action card suggests that admins visit the **Integrated apps** section of the Microsoft 365 admin center to explore and enable more agents for users in their organization.

To learn more about managing and enabling agents in your organization, see [Manage Copilot agents in Integrated Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-copilot-agents-integrated-apps).

### Agent details table

[![Screenshot showing the detail table for agent usage in Microsoft Copilot.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/media/agents-details.png?view=o365-worldwide)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/media/agents-details.png?view=o365-worldwide#lightbox)

| Metric | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| App ID | App identifier generated by Microsoft. It matches the App details page of the app in [Manage Apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps) in the Microsoft Teams admin center. |
| Agent name | The name of the app as present in the app manifest. |
| Active users in Copilot | The number of distinct users in your organization that are using the agent. |
| Last activity date \(UTC\) | The date when anyone in your organization last used the agent. |
| External app ID | App identifier defined during app creation. This identifier is only applicable for custom apps. It matches the app details page of the app in [Manage Apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps) in the Microsoft Teams admin center. |

Note

The agent details table lists all active agents that admins approve and users create. Due to system limitations, some rows might not display the agent name or External app ID. If only the External app ID is available, IT admins can find the agent name in the manage apps section of the Microsoft Teams admin center by following the steps in the [FAQ section](#faq).

## FAQ

### Are agents created from Microsoft Copilot Studio and Teams Toolkit included?

Yes. The report includes usage for the following agents:

- Agents that users in your org create in Microsoft Copilot Studio and admins approve.
- Agents that users in your org create in Teams Toolkit and admins approve.
- Agents that users create through [agent builder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/copilot-studio-agent-builder) for users who have this feature enabled and share with other users in your org.

### Are agents published by Microsoft or Microsoft Partners included?

No. Currently, the report doesn't include the usage of agents built by Microsoft or Partners.

### Why can't I see the agent name or External app ID in the Details section, even though I see the App ID, active users, and last activity date?

Due to system limitations, the information about the agent name for the agents that users create in [Agent Builder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/copilot-studio-agent-builder) isn't currently available. However, the aggregated metrics above the table include the usage of these agents.

If you see the External app ID but not the agent name, you can identify your organization's agent name by looking up the External app ID in the Microsoft Teams admin center under **Manage apps**. Admins can also export the details table in the agent report and export the managed apps in Microsoft Teams admin center for a bulk lookup of agent name.

### How can I see which users actively used specific agents?

This information isn't available in the report at this time, but it might be added at a later date.

### How does agent usage affect overall Microsoft Copilot usage?

The top-line Microsoft Copilot usage number already includes agent usage. Users can only use agents through Copilot Chat and Copilot in Office apps. The all-up Microsoft Copilot usage report already captures usage of these apps and includes data for all features and functionalities of Copilot.
