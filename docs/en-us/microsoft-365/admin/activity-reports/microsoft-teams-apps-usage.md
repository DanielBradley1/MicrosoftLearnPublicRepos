# Microsoft Teams apps App usage report

The Microsoft Teams apps App usage report provides insights into app activity across your organization. Use this report to understand which apps users install and actively use, and explore adoption trends at a per-app and per-user level.

For general information about usage reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center, and to see a list of all available reports, see [Microsoft 365 admin center usage reports overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/activity-reports?view=o365-worldwide).

5. Or, on the **Usage** page, under **Reports**, select **Microsoft Teams apps**.
6. On the report page, select the **App usage** tab.

### Report considerations

- It can take about five days for usage and installs data for a newly published app to appear in the report. Data for a given day appears within 48 hours. For example, data for January 10 appears in the report by around January 12.
- The start date for all installs metrics is October 2021. The report only counts apps installed after that date.
- The report uses External \(manifest\) App IDs. For information about how to tie this ID to an app in the **Manage Apps** experience in Teams admin center, see [Manage app setup policies in Microsoft Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies#install-apps).

To export the report data into an Excel .csv file, select **Export**. This action exports the usage data of all users and enables you to do simple sorting, filtering, and searching for further analysis.

## Interpret the Microsoft Teams apps App usage report

The Teams apps App usage report is available in the Microsoft 365 admin center and provides data through two separate reports:

- The **App usage** report
- The **User activity** report

### App usage tab

The **App usage** report helps answer the following questions:

- How many apps do users in your environment install?
- How many apps have at least one active user in your environment?
- How many apps are used by platform \(Windows, Mac, Web, or mobile\)?
- How many active users and active teams use the app?

To view the **App usage** report, select the **Apps usage** tab.

[![Screenshot of the App usage tab of the Microsoft Teams apps usage report showing installed and used app trends.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/media/teams-apps-usage-tab.png?view=o365-worldwide)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/media/teams-apps-usage-tab.png?view=o365-worldwide#lightbox)

At the top of the report, three charts describe cross-app trends across your organization.

- Apps installed
- Apps used
- Platform

The report displays trends over the last 7, 30, 90, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table shows data for up to 28 days from the current date, not the date the report generated.

To filter all charts, use the time range picker in the top corner of the **App usage** tab.

Note

By default, user-specific information like usernames, display names, groups, and sites is hidden in usage reports. To learn how to display this information in usage reports, see [Show user, group, or site details in usage reports](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/activity-reports?view=o365-worldwide#show-user-group-or-site-details-in-usage-reports).

## Manage apps in the Teams admin center

For information about how to manage your Teams apps, see [About apps in Microsoft Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/deploy-apps-microsoft-teams-landing-page).

To link an app in this report to the Manage Apps experience in the Teams admin center, use the following items:

- App Name
- External App ID

External App IDs are equivalent to the ID in the **Manage apps** page for Store apps. For custom apps, to view External App ID in the **Manage apps** page, follow the instructions on [Manage apps setup policies in Microsoft Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies) to add the column in the column settings. You can also view it on the app details page for a custom app.

## FAQ

### I blocked the Teams app in the Teams admin center. Why does it still show usage in the apps usage report in Teams admin center?

Even if you block an app in the Teams admin center, usage signals might still appear in the [Teams app usage report](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-analytics-and-reports/app-usage-report) or in the [Microsoft 365 Teams app usage report](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/microsoft-teams-apps-usage?view=o365-worldwide). This situation can happen due to passive user interactions, such as viewing a card posted by the app in a chat or channel. These interactions can generate telemetry without the user actively launching or interacting with the app.

### If I block a Teams app in the Teams admin center, is it still being used?

No. Blocking the app in the Teams admin center prevents users from launching or executing it. The app isn't running, and users can't interact with it directly. However, the usage report includes a broader range of signals beyond just app launches.

### Is the app usage report inaccurate?

The report is accurate, but it's intentionally inclusive. It reflects a wider set of usage types, including passive views of app content. This approach provides visibility into all the ways users might be exposed to app functionality, even if the app is blocked from active use.

### Does blocking an app in the Teams admin center stop all usage across Microsoft 365?

No. When you block an app in the Teams admin center, users can't install or launch it in Teams. This action doesn't block passive exposure or usage in other Microsoft 365 surfaces like Outlook or the Microsoft 365 app.

Block the app in both the Teams admin center and the Microsoft 365 admin center. If your organization uses [Unified app management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/manage-apps-across-m365#what-is-unified-app-management), settings made in one admin center sync with the other. This synchronization doesn't prevent passive usage.

### Does the report differentiate between "passive" usage vs "actual" usage, so I can be certain there's no app usage occurring?

Currently, there are no plans to separate passive usage from active usage in the report.
