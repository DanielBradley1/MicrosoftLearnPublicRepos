## Interpret the Microsoft Teams User activity report

The report displays trends over the last 7, 30, 90, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table shows data for up to 28 days from the current date, not the date the report generated.

To ensure data quality, the system performs daily data validation checks for the past three days and fills any detected gaps. You might notice differences in historical data during this process.

Note

By default, user-specific information like usernames, display names, groups, and sites is hidden in usage reports. To learn how to display this information in usage reports, see [Show user, group, or site details in usage reports](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/activity-reports?view=o365-worldwide#show-user-group-or-site-details-in-usage-reports).

Note

- Metric counts include Teams client built-in features, but don't include changes to chat and channel through service integration, such as Teams app posts or replies and emails in the channel.
- Audio and video duration metrics represent participation time in meetings where audio or video was enabled, not active speaking or camera-on time.
