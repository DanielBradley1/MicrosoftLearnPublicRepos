# Configure block at first sight in Microsoft Defender Antivirus

Block at first sight is a threat protection feature of [next-generation protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/next-generation-protection). It detects new malware and blocks it within seconds. The feature is enabled when all of the following statements are true:

- [Cloud protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus) \(also called *cloud-delivered protection* in Windows Security\) is turned on.
- [Sample submission](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/cloud-protection-microsoft-antivirus-sample-submission) is set to send samples automatically.
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus [is up to date](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-updates) on devices.

In most enterprise organizations, these settings are already configured with Microsoft Defender Antivirus deployments. For more information, see [Configure cloud protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/cloud-protection-configure).

When Microsoft Defender Antivirus finds a suspicious file it hasn't seen before, it sends a query to the cloud protection backend. The cloud backend checks the file using heuristics, machine learning, and automated analysis. It then decides if the file is malicious or safe. Microsoft Defender Antivirus uses multiple detection and prevention methods to deliver accurate, real-time protection.

Keep the following details in mind when using block at first sight:

- Block at first sight can block executable files and nonportable executable files \(such as JS, VBS, or macros\) on Windows or Windows Server devices that run the [latest Defender antimalware platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-updates).
- Block at first sight only uses the cloud protection backend for executable files and nonportable executable files that are downloaded from the Internet, or that originate from the Internet zone. A hash value of the `.exe` file is checked via the cloud backend to determine if the file is a previously undetected file.
- If the cloud backend is unable to make a determination, Microsoft Defender Antivirus locks the file and uploads a copy to the cloud. The cloud performs more analysis to reach a determination. The cloud then either allows the file to run or blocks the file in all future encounters, depending on whether the cloud determines the file to be malicious or not a threat.
- In many cases, this cloud-based analysis and blocking process can reduce the response time for new malware from hours to seconds.
- You can [specify how long a file should be prevented from running](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/configure-cloud-block-timeout-period-microsoft-defender-antivirus) while the cloud-based protection service analyzes the file. You can also [customize the message displayed on users' desktops](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/system-security/windows-defender-security-center/wdsc-customize-contact-information) when a file is blocked. You can change the company name, contact information, and message URL.

Caution

Turning off block at first sight lowers the protection state of your devices and your network. We don't recommend disabling block at first sight permanently.

## Prerequisites

### Supported operating systems

Block at first sight is supported on the following operating systems:

- Windows

## Configure block at first sight using Microsoft Intune

Microsoft Intune is the recommended tool for configuring and distributing Defender for Endpoint features to devices. However, Intune is a separate product that isn't part of Defender for Endpoint, and it isn't included in all subscriptions. To use Intune, you need a subscription that includes it, or you can buy it separately as a standalone subscription or add-on. If you don't have Intune, you can use any of the other methods in this article. For more information, see [Microsoft Intune licensing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/licenses).

To configure block at first sight in Microsoft Intune, use an endpoint security **Antivirus** policy. For detailed instructions, see [Create endpoint security policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/protect/endpoint-security-policy#create-endpoint-security-policies) or [Modify existing policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/device-configuration/endpoint-security/manage-policies#modify-existing-policies) \(links open new tabs in the Intune documentation\).

When you create the policy, use these specific settings:

- **Policy type**: Go to **Manage** > **Antivirus** on the **Endpoint security \| Overview** page at [https://intune.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft\_Intune\_Workflows/SecurityManagementMenu/~/overview](https://intune.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Intune_Workflows/SecurityManagementMenu/%7E/overview), and then select ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/media/defender-portal-icon-create.png) **Create policy**.
- **Platform**: Select **Windows**.
- **Profile**: Select **Microsoft Defender Antivirus**.

### Turn on block at first sight with Microsoft Intune

When you create or modify the policy, use these specific settings on the **Configuration settings** tab:

  - **Send safe samples automatically. \(Default\)**
  - **Send all samples automatically**

### Turn off block at first sight with the Microsoft Defender portal

To turn off block at first sight, set **Allow cloud protection** to **Not allowed. Turns off Cloud Protection**.

## Configure block at first sight in Microsoft Configuration Manager

For instructions to create and deploy an antimalware policy, see [Endpoint Protection antimalware policies in Configuration Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/configmgr/protect/deploy-use/endpoint-antimalware-policies).

Configuration Manager doesn't include a separate setting named **Block at First Sight**. Configure the cloud protection and sample submission settings that the feature requires.

### Turn on block at first sight with Microsoft Configuration Manager

To turn on block at first sight, configure the following settings in the antimalware policy:

- **Advanced Settings**:

  - **Enable auto sample file submission to help Microsoft determine whether certain detected items are Malicious**: Select **Yes**.

- **Cloud Protection Service**:

  - **Cloud Protection Service membership**: Select **Advanced**.

### Turn off block at first sight with Microsoft Configuration Manager

To turn off block at first sight, set **Cloud Protection Service membership** to **Do not join Cloud Protection Service**.

## Configure block at first sight using Group Policy

1. In Centralized Group Policy, open the [Group Policy Management Console \(GPMC\)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/group-policy/group-policy-management-console) on your Group Policy management computer.
2. In the GPMC console tree, expand Group Policy Objects in the forest and domain containing the GPO you want to edit.
3. Right-click the GPO, and then select **Edit**.
4. In the **Group Policy Management Editor**, go to **Computer configuration** > **Administrative templates** > **Windows components** > **Microsoft Defender Antivirus** > **MAPS**.

      - **Send safe samples** \(0x1\)
      - **Send all samples** \(0x3\)


      Important


      **Always prompt** \(0x0\) lowers the protection state of the device. **Never send** \(0x2\) prevents block at first sight from functioning.

   3. Select **OK**.

### Turn off block at first sight with Group Policy

Tip

Disabling block at first sight doesn't disable or change the cloud protection and sample submission policies.

To turn off block at first sight in the Group Policy **MAPS** settings, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Configure the 'Block at First Sight' feature** setting.
2. In the setting window that opens, select **Disabled**, and then select **OK**.

## Configure block at first sight using PowerShell

Run the commands in an elevated PowerShell session \(a PowerShell window you opened by selecting **Run as administrator**\).

### Turn on block at first sight with PowerShell

The following command turns on cloud protection, automatic safe sample submission, and block at first sight:

```powershell
Set-MpPreference -MAPSReporting Advanced -SubmitSamplesConsent SendSafeSamples -DisableBlockAtFirstSeen $false
```

To submit all samples automatically instead of only safe samples, use `SendAllSamples` for the *SubmitSamplesConsent* value.

### Verify the configuration

The following command displays the current block at first sight settings:

```powershell
Get-MpPreference | Select-Object MAPSReporting, SubmitSamplesConsent, DisableBlockAtFirstSeen
```

To verify block at first sight is turned on, confirm the following values:

- *MAPSReporting*: `2` \(Advanced\)
- *SubmitSamplesConsent*: `1` \(Send safe samples automatically\) or `3` \(Send all samples automatically\)
- *DisableBlockAtFirstSeen*: `False`

### Turn off block at first sight with PowerShell

The following command turns off block at first sight without changing the cloud protection and sample submission settings:

```powershell
Set-MpPreference -DisableBlockAtFirstSeen $true
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [**Set-MpPreference**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/defender/set-mppreference) and [**Get-MpPreference**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/defender/get-mppreference).

## Configure block at first sight in the Windows Security app

On an unmanaged device, you can configure block at first sight in the [Windows Security app](https://support.microsoft.com/Windows/Security/Windows-Security/stay-protected-with-the-windows-security-app). Although the app doesn't have a setting named **Block at first sight**, the feature turns on when you enable cloud-delivered protection and automatic sample submission.

Note

If Group Policy manages these settings, they appear greyed-out in the Windows Security app and can't be changed locally.

Group Policy changes must reach the device before the settings are updated in the Windows Security app.

To configure block at first sight, follow these steps:

1. In the **Windows security** app on the device, go to **Virus & threat protection**.
2. In the **Virus & threat protection** pane, in the **Virus & threat protection settings** section, select **Manage settings**.
3. In the **Virus & threat protection settings** pane, take one of the following actions:

   - To turn on block at first sight, turn on **Cloud-delivered protection** and **Automatic sample submission**.
   - To turn off block at first sight, turn off either setting.
