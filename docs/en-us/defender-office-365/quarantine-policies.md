# Configure quarantine policies in cloud organizations

Tip

*Did you know you can try the features in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 for free?* Use the 90-day Defender for Office 365 trial at the [Microsoft Defender portal trials hub](https://security.microsoft.com/trialHorizontalHub?sku=MDO&ref=DocsRef). Learn about who can sign up and trial terms on [Try Microsoft Defender for Office 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365).

In all organizations with cloud mailboxes, *quarantine policies* allow admins to define the user experience for quarantined messages:

- What users are allowed to do to their own quarantined messages \(messages where they're a recipient\) based on why the message was quarantined.
- Whether users receive periodic \(every four hours, daily, or weekly\) notifications about their quarantined messages via [quarantine notifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-quarantine-notifications).

Traditionally, users are allowed or denied levels of interactivity with quarantined messages based on why the message was quarantined. For example, users can view and release messages quarantined as spam or bulk, but they can't view or release messages quarantined as high confidence phishing or malware.

Default quarantine policies enforce these historical user capabilities, and are automatically assigned in [supported protection features](#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features) that quarantine messages.

For details about the elements of a quarantine policy, default quarantine policies, and individual permissions, see the [Appendix](#appendix).

If you don't like the default user capabilities for quarantined messages for a specific feature \(including the lack of quarantine notifications\), you can create and use custom quarantine policies as described in this article.

You create and assign quarantine policies in the Microsoft Defender portal or in [Exchange Online PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

## Before you begin

- In Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet in China, quarantine isn't currently available in the Microsoft Defender portal. Quarantine is available only in the classic Exchange admin center \(classic EAC\).
- You open the Microsoft Defender portal at [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com). To go directly to the **Quarantine policies** page, use [https://security.microsoft.com/quarantinePolicies](https://security.microsoft.com/quarantinePolicies).
- To connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).
- If you change the quarantine policy assigned to a supported protection feature, the change affects quarantined message *after* you make the change. The new quarantine policy assignment doesn't affect messages quarantined before you made the change.
- The **Retain spam in quarantine for this many days** \(*QuarantineRetentionPeriod*\) setting in anti-spam policies controls how long quarantined messages are held. This retention period applies to messages quarantined by anti-spam and anti-phishing protection. For more information, see the table in [Quarantine retention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-about#quarantine-retention).
- You need to be assigned permissions before you can do the procedures in this article. You have the following options:

  - [Microsoft Defender XDR Unified role based access control \(RBAC\)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/manage-rbac) \(If **Email & collaboration** > **Defender for Office 365** permissions is ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/scc-toggle-on.png) **Active**. Affects the Defender portal only, not PowerShell\): **Authorization and settings/Security settings/Core Security settings \(manage\)**, or **Security operations/Security Data/Email & collaboration quarantine \(manage\)**.
  - [Email & collaboration permissions in the Microsoft Defender portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/mdo-portal-permissions): Membership in the **Quarantine Administrator**, **Security Administrator**, or **Organization Management** role groups.
  - [Microsoft Entra permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/manage-roles-portal): Membership in the **Microsoft Entra Global Administrator**<sup>\*</sup> or **Security Administrator** roles gives users the required permissions *and* permissions for other features in Microsoft 365.

    Important

    \<sup>\*</sup> Microsoft strongly advocates for the principle of least privilege. Assigning accounts only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks helps reduce security risks and strengthens your organization's overall protection. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that you should limit to emergency scenarios or when you can't use a different role.

- All actions taken by admins or users on quarantined messages are audited. For more information about audited quarantine events, see [Quarantine schema in the Office 365 Management API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-schema#quarantine-schema).

## Step 1: Create quarantine policies in the Microsoft Defender portal

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal at [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Email & collaboration** > **Policies & rules** > **Threat policies** > **Quarantine policy** in the **Rules** section. Or, to go directly to the **Quarantine policy** page, use [https://security.microsoft.com/quarantinePolicies](https://security.microsoft.com/quarantinePolicies).

   [![Screenshot of the Quarantine policy page in the Microsoft Defender portal.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/mdo-quarantine-policy-page.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/mdo-quarantine-policy-page.png#lightbox)
2. On the **Quarantine policies** page, select ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-create.png) **Add custom policy** to start the new quarantine policy wizard.
3. On the **Policy name** page, enter a brief but unique name in the **Policy name** box. The policy name is selectable in dropdown lists in upcoming steps.

   When you're finished on the **Policy name** page, select **Next**.
4. On the **Recipient message access** page, select one of the following values:

   - **Limited access**: The individual permissions that are included in this permission group are described in the [Appendix](#appendix) section. Basically, users can do anything to their quarantined messages except release them from quarantine without admin approval.
   - **Set specific access \(Advanced\)**: Use this value to specify custom permissions. Configure the following settings that appear:

     - **Select release action preference**: Select one of the following values from the dropdown list:

       - Blank: Users can't release or request the release of their messages from quarantine. The default value.
       - **Allow recipients to request a message to be released from quarantine**
       - **Allow recipients to release a message from quarantine**

     - **Select additional actions recipients can take on quarantined messages**: Select some, all, or none of the following values:

       - **Delete**
       - **Preview**
       - **Block sender**
       - **Allow sender**


   These permissions and their effect on quarantined messages and in quarantine notifications are described in [Quarantine policy permission details](#quarantine-policy-permission-details).


   When you're finished on the **Recipient message access** page, select **Next**.

5. On the **Quarantine notification** page, select **Enable** to turn on quarantine notifications, and then select one of the following values:

   - **Include quarantined messages from blocked sender addresses**
   - **Don't include quarantined messages from blocked sender addresses**


   Tip


   If you select **Don't include quarantined messages from blocked sender addresses**, recipients aren't notified for messages quarantined due to blocked senders or Bulk detections. Recipients are notified about messages quarantined for other reasons.


   If you turn on quarantine notifications for **No access** permissions \(on the **Recipient message access** page, you selected **Set specific access \(Advanced\)** > **Select release action preference** > blank\), users can view their messages in quarantine, but the only available action for the messages is ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-view-message-headers.png) [View message headers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#view-email-message-headers).


   When you're finished on the **Quarantine notification** page, select **Next**.

6. On the **Review policy** page, you can review your selections. Select **Edit** in each section to modify the settings within the section. Or you can select **Back** or the specific page in the wizard.

   When you're finished on the **Review policy** page, select **Submit**, and then select **Done** in the confirmation page.
7. On the confirmation page that appears, you can use the links to review quarantined messages or go to the **Anti-spam policies** page in the Defender portal.

   When you're finished on the page, select **Done**.

Back on the **Quarantine policy** page, the policy that you created is now listed. You're ready to [assign the quarantine policy to a supported protection feature](#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features).

### Create quarantine policies in PowerShell

Tip

The PermissionToAllowSender permission in quarantine policies in PowerShell isn't used.

If you'd rather use PowerShell to create quarantine policies, connect to [Exchange Online PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell). Use the following command to create a custom quarantine policy by specifying the combined end-user permissions value and whether quarantine notifications are enabled:

```powershell
New-QuarantinePolicy -Name "<UniqueName>" -EndUserQuarantinePermissionsValue <0 to 236> [-EsnEnabled $true]
```

- The *ESNEnabled* parameter with the value `$true` turns on quarantine notifications. Quarantine notifications are turned off by default \(the default value is `$false`\).
- The *EndUserQuarantinePermissionsValue* parameter uses a decimal value converted from a binary value. The binary value corresponds to the available end-user quarantine permissions in a specific order. For each permission, the value 1 equals True and the value 0 equals False.

  The required order and values for each individual permission are described in the following table:

  | Permission | Decimal value | Binary value |
  | --- | :---: | :---: |
  | PermissionToViewHeader¹ | 128 | 10000000 |
  | PermissionToDownload² | 64 | 01000000 |
  | PermissionToAllowSender | 32 | 00100000 |
  | PermissionToBlockSender | 16 | 00010000 |
  | PermissionToRequestRelease³ | 8 | 00001000 |
  | PermissionToRelease³ | 4 | 00000100 |
  | PermissionToPreview | 2 | 00000010 |
  | PermissionToDelete | 1 | 00000001 |


  ¹ The value 0 for this permission doesn't hide the ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-view-message-headers.png) **View message header** action in quarantine. If the message is visible to a user in quarantine, the action is always available for the message.


  ² This permission isn't used \(the value 0 or 1 does nothing\).


  ³ Don't set both of these permission values to 1. Set one value to 1 and the other value to 0, or set both values to 0.


  For Limited access permissions, the required values are:


  | Permission | Limited access |
  | --- | :---: |
  | PermissionToViewHeader | 0 |
  | PermissionToDownload | 0 |
  | PermissionToAllowSender | 1 |
  | PermissionToBlockSender | 0 |
  | PermissionToRequestRelease | 1 |
  | PermissionToRelease | 0 |
  | PermissionToPreview | 1 |
  | PermissionToDelete | 1 |
  | Binary value | 00101011 |
  | Decimal value to use | 43 |

- If you set the *ESNEnabled* parameter to the value `$true` when the value of the *EndUserQuarantinePermissionsValue* parameter is 0 \(**No access** where all permissions are turned off\), recipients can see their messages in quarantine, but the only available action for the messages is ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-view-message-headers.png) [View message headers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#view-email-message-headers).

This example creates a quarantine policy named LimitedAccess that assigns the **Limited access** permission set \(decimal value 43\) and enables quarantine notifications.

```powershell
New-QuarantinePolicy -Name LimitedAccess -EndUserQuarantinePermissionsValue 43 -EsnEnabled $true
```

For custom permissions, use the previous table to get the binary value that corresponds to the permissions you want. Convert the binary value to a decimal value and use the decimal value for the *EndUserQuarantinePermissionsValue* parameter.

Tip

Use the equivalent **decimal** value for *EndUserQuarantinePermissionsValue*. Don't use the raw binary value.

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-QuarantinePolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/new-quarantinepolicy).

## Step 2: Assign a quarantine policy to supported features

In supported protection features that quarantine email messages, the assigned quarantine policy defines what users can do to quarantined messages and whether quarantine notifications are turned on. Protection features that quarantine messages and whether they support quarantine policies are described in the following table:

| Feature | Quarantine policies supported? |
| --- | :---: |
| **Verdicts in [anti-spam policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-spam-policies-configure)** |  |
| Spam \(*SpamAction*\) | Yes \(*SpamQuarantineTag*\) |
| High confidence spam \(*HighConfidenceSpamAction*\) | Yes \(*HighConfidenceSpamQuarantineTag*\) |
| Phishing \(*PhishSpamAction*\) | Yes \(*PhishQuarantineTag*\) |
| High confidence phishing \(*HighConfidencePhishAction*\) | Yes \(*HighConfidencePhishQuarantineTag*\) |
| Bulk \(*BulkSpamAction*\) | Yes \(*BulkQuarantineTag*\) |
| **Verdicts in [anti-phishing policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-phishing-policies-about)** |  |
| Spoof \(*AuthenticationFailAction*\) | Yes \(*SpoofQuarantineTag*\) |
| User impersonation \(*TargetedUserProtectionAction*\) | Yes \(*TargetedUserQuarantineTag*\) |
| Domain impersonation \(*TargetedDomainProtectionAction*\) | Yes \(*TargetedDomainQuarantineTag*\) |
| Mailbox intelligence impersonation \(*MailboxIntelligenceProtectionAction*\) | Yes \(*MailboxIntelligenceQuarantineTag*\) |
| **[Anti-malware policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-malware-policies-configure)** | Yes \(*QuarantineTag*\) |
| **[Safe Attachments protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/safe-attachments-about)** |  |
| Email messages with attachments quarantined as malware or phishing by Safe Attachments policies \(*Enable* and *Action*\) | Yes \(*QuarantineTag*\) |
| Files quarantined as malware or phishing by [Safe Attachments for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/safe-attachments-for-spo-odfb-teams-about) | No |
| **[Exchange mail flow rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rules) \(also known as transport rules\) with the action: 'Deliver the message to the hosted quarantine' \(*Quarantine*\)** | No |

The default quarantine policies used by each protection feature are described in the related tables in [Recommended email and collaboration threat policy settings for cloud organizations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365).

The default quarantine policies, preset permission groups, and permissions are described in the [Appendix](#appendix) section at the end of this article.

The rest of this step explains how to assign quarantine policies for supported filter verdicts.

## Assign quarantine policies in supported policies in the Microsoft Defender portal

Note

Users can't release their own quarantined messages in the following scenarios, regardless of how the quarantine policy is configured:

- Messages quarantined as malware by anti-malware policies.
- Messages quarantined as malware or phishing by Safe Attachments policies.
- Messages quarantined as high confidence phishing by anti-spam policies.

If the policy is configured for users to release these quarantined messages, users are instead allowed to *request* the release of these quarantined messages.

### Anti-spam policies

To assign a quarantine policy in an anti-spam policy, do the following steps:

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal at [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Email & collaboration** > **Policies & rules** > **Threat policies** > **Anti-spam** in the **Policies** section. Or, to go directly to the **Anti-spam policies** page, use [https://security.microsoft.com/antispam](https://security.microsoft.com/antispam).
2. On the **Anti-spam policies** page, use either of the following methods:

   - Select an existing **inbound** anti-spam policy by clicking anywhere in the row other than the check box next to the name. In the policy details flyout that opens, go to the **Actions** section and then select **Edit actions**.
   - Select ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-create.png) **Create policy**, select **Inbound** from the dropdown list to start the new anti-spam policy wizard, and then get to the **Actions** page.

3. On the **Actions** page or flyout, every verdict that has the **Quarantine message** action selected also has the **Select quarantine policy** box for you to select a quarantine policy.

   During the creation of the anti-spam policy, if you *change* the action of a spam filtering verdict to **Quarantine message**, the **Select quarantine policy** box is blank by default. A blank value means the default quarantine policy for that verdict is used. When you later view or edit the anti-spam policy settings, the quarantine policy name is shown. The default quarantine policies are listed in the [supported features table](#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features).

   [![The Quarantine policy selections in an anti-spam policy.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/quarantine-tags-in-anti-spam-policies.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/quarantine-tags-in-anti-spam-policies.png#lightbox)

Full instructions for creating and modifying anti-spam policies are described in [Configure anti-spam policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-spam-policies-configure).

#### Anti-spam policies in PowerShell

If you'd rather use [Exchange Online PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell) to assign quarantine policies in anti-spam policies, use the following syntax to create or update an anti-spam policy and assign custom quarantine policies to spam, phishing, and bulk verdict actions:

```powershell
<New-HostedContentFilterPolicy -Name "<Unique name>" | Set-HostedContentFilterPolicy -Identity "<Policy name>"> [-SpamAction Quarantine] [-SpamQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] [-HighConfidenceSpamAction Quarantine] [-HighConfidenceSpamQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] [-PhishSpamAction Quarantine] [-PhishQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] [-HighConfidencePhishQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] [-BulkSpamAction Quarantine] [-BulkQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] ...
```

- Quarantine policies matter only when messages are quarantined. The default value for the *HighConfidencePhishAction* parameter is Quarantine, so you don't need to use that *\*Action* parameter when you create new spam filter policies in PowerShell. By default, all other *\*Action* parameters in new spam filter policies aren't set to value Quarantine.

  To review the quarantine actions and assigned quarantine policies in your existing anti-spam policies, run the following command:

  ```powershell
  Get-HostedContentFilterPolicy | Format-List Name,SpamAction,SpamQuarantineTag,HighConfidenceSpamAction,HighConfidenceSpamQuarantineTag,PhishSpamAction,PhishQuarantineTag,HighConfidencePhishAction,HighConfidencePhishQuarantineTag,BulkSpamAction,BulkQuarantineTag
  ```

- If you create an anti-spam policy without specifying the quarantine policy for the spam filtering verdict, the default quarantine policy for that verdict is used. For information about the default action values and the recommended action values for Standard and Strict, see [Anti-spam policy settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365#anti-spam-policy-settings).

  Specify a different quarantine policy to turn on quarantine notifications or change the default end-user capabilities on quarantined messages for that particular spam filtering verdict.

  Users can't release their own messages quarantined as high confidence phishing by anti-spam policies, regardless of how the quarantine policy is configured. If the policy is configured for users to release these quarantined messages, users are instead allowed to *request* the release of these quarantined messages.
- In PowerShell, a new anti-spam policy in PowerShell requires a spam filter policy using the **New-HostedContentFilterPolicy** cmdlet \(settings\), and an exclusive spam filter rule using the **New-HostedContentFilterRule** cmdlet \(recipient filters\). For instructions, see [Use PowerShell to create anti-spam policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-spam-policies-configure#use-powershell-to-create-anti-spam-policies).

This example creates an anti-spam policy named Research Department that quarantines all spam filtering verdicts \(spam, high-confidence spam, phishing, and bulk\) and assigns the AdminOnlyAccessPolicy quarantine policy \(**No access** permissions\) to each verdict. By default, high confidence phishing messages are already quarantined with AdminOnlyAccessPolicy.

```powershell
New-HostedContentFilterPolicy -Name "Research Department" -SpamAction Quarantine -SpamQuarantineTag AdminOnlyAccessPolicy -HighConfidenceSpamAction Quarantine -HighConfidenceSpamQuarantineTag AdminOnlyAccessPolicy -PhishSpamAction Quarantine -PhishQuarantineTag AdminOnlyAccessPolicy -BulkSpamAction Quarantine -BulkQuarantineTag AdminOnlyAccessPolicy
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-HostedContentFilterPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/new-hostedcontentfilterpolicy).

This example updates the existing Human Resources anti-spam policy so the spam verdict action is set to Quarantine and the custom quarantine policy named ContosoNoAccess is assigned.

```powershell
Set-HostedContentFilterPolicy -Identity "Human Resources" -SpamAction Quarantine -SpamQuarantineTag ContosoNoAccess
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-HostedContentFilterPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/set-hostedcontentfilterpolicy).

### Anti-phishing policies

Spoof intelligence is available in all organizations with cloud mailboxes. User impersonation protection, domain impersonation protection, and mailbox intelligence protection are available only in Microsoft 365 organizations with Defender for Office 365. For more information, see [Anti-phishing policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-phishing-policies-about).

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal at [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Email & collaboration** > **Policies & rules** > **Threat policies** > **Anti-phishing** in the **Policies** section. Or, to go directly to the **Anti-phishing** page, use [https://security.microsoft.com/antiphishing](https://security.microsoft.com/antiphishing).
2. On the **Anti-phishing** page, use either of the following methods:

   - Select an existing anti-phishing policy by clicking anywhere in the row other than the check box next to the name. In the policy details flyout that opens, select the **Edit** link in the relevant section as described in the next steps.
   - Select ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-create.png) **Create** to start the new anti-phishing policy wizard. The relevant pages are described in the next steps.

3. On the **Phishing threshold & protection** page or flyout, verify that the following settings are turned on and configured as required:

   - **Enabled users to protect**: Specify users.
   - **Enabled domains to protect**: Select **Include domains I own** and/or **Include custom domains** and specify the domains.
   - **Enable mailbox intelligence**
   - **Enable intelligence for impersonation protection**
   - **Enable spoof intelligence**

4. On the **Actions** page or flyout, every verdict that has the **Quarantine the message** action also has the **Apply quarantine policy** box for you to select a quarantine policy.

   During the creation of the anti-phishing policy, if you don't select a quarantine policy, the default quarantine policy is used. When you later view or edit the anti-phishing policy settings, the quarantine policy name is shown. The default quarantine policies are listed in the [supported features table](#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features).

   [![The Quarantine policy selections in an anti-phishing policy.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/quarantine-tags-in-anti-phishing-policies.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/quarantine-tags-in-anti-phishing-policies.png#lightbox)

Full instructions for creating and modifying anti-phishing policies are available in the following articles:

- [Configure anti-phishing policies if you don't have Microsoft Defender for Office 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-phishing-policies-eop-configure)
- [Configure anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-phishing-policies-mdo-configure)

#### Anti-phishing policies in PowerShell

If you'd rather use [Exchange Online PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell) to assign quarantine policies in anti-phishing policies, use the following syntax to create or update an anti-phishing policy and assign quarantine policies to spoof, mailbox intelligence, targeted domain, and targeted user protections:

```powershell
<New-AntiPhishPolicy -Name "<Unique name>" | Set-AntiPhishPolicy -Identity "<Policy name>"> [-EnableSpoofIntelligence $true] [-AuthenticationFailAction Quarantine] [-SpoofQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] [-EnableMailboxIntelligence $true] [-EnableMailboxIntelligenceProtection $true] [-MailboxIntelligenceProtectionAction Quarantine] [-MailboxIntelligenceQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] [-EnableOrganizationDomainsProtection $true] [-EnableTargetedDomainsProtection $true] [-TargetedDomainProtectionAction Quarantine] [-TargetedDomainQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] [-EnableTargetedUserProtection $true] [-TargetedUserProtectionAction Quarantine] [-TargetedUserQuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] ...
```

- Quarantine policies matter only when messages are quarantined. In anti-phish policies, messages are quarantined when the *Enable\** parameter value for the feature is $true **and** the corresponding *\*\\Action* parameter value is Quarantine. The default value for the *EnableMailboxIntelligence* and *EnableSpoofIntelligence* parameters is $true, so you don't need to use them when you create new anti-phish policies in PowerShell. By default, no *\*\\Action* parameters have the value Quarantine.

  To inspect the anti-phishing features that quarantine messages and the quarantine tags assigned to each action in your existing policies, run the following command:

  ```powershell
  Get-AntiPhishPolicy | Format-List EnableSpoofIntelligence,AuthenticationFailAction,SpoofQuarantineTag,EnableTargetedUserProtection,TargetedUserProtectionAction,TargetedUserQuarantineTag,EnableTargetedDomainsProtection,EnableOrganizationDomainsProtection,TargetedDomainProtectionAction,TargetedDomainQuarantineTag,EnableMailboxIntelligence,EnableMailboxIntelligenceProtection,MailboxIntelligenceProtectionAction,MailboxIntelligenceQuarantineTag
  ```


  For information about the default and recommended action values for Standard and Strict configurations, see [Anti-phishing policy settings for all cloud mailboxes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365#anti-phishing-policy-settings-for-all-cloud-mailboxes) and [Impersonation settings in anti-phishing policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365#impersonation-settings-in-anti-phishing-policies-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365).

- If you create a new anti-phishing policy without specifying the quarantine policy for the anti-phishing action, the default quarantine policy for that action is used. The default quarantine policies for each anti-phishing action are shown in [Anti-phishing policy settings for all cloud mailboxes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365#anti-phishing-policy-settings-for-all-cloud-mailboxes) and [Anti-phishing policy settings in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365#anti-phishing-policy-settings-in-microsoft-defender-for-office-365).

  Specify a different quarantine policy only if you want to change the default end-user capabilities on quarantined messages for that particular anti-phishing action.
- A new anti-phishing policy in PowerShell requires an anti-phish policy using the **New-AntiPhishPolicy** cmdlet \(settings\), and an exclusive anti-phish rule using the **New-AntiPhishRule** cmdlet \(recipient filters\). For instructions, see the following articles:

  - [Use Exchange Online PowerShell to configure anti-phishing if you don't have Defender for Office 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-phishing-policies-eop-configure#use-exchange-online-powershell-to-configure-anti-phishing-policies)
  - [Use Exchange Online PowerShell to configure anti-phishing policies in Defender for Office 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-phishing-policies-mdo-configure#use-exchange-online-powershell-to-configure-anti-phishing-policies)

This example creates an anti-phishing policy named Research Department that quarantines messages detected by spoof intelligence, mailbox intelligence, targeted domain protection, and targeted user protection, and assigns the NoAccess quarantine policy \(**No access** permissions\) to each detection.

```powershell
New-AntiPhishPolicy -Name "Research Department" -AuthenticationFailAction Quarantine -SpoofQuarantineTag NoAccess -EnableMailboxIntelligenceProtection $true -MailboxIntelligenceProtectionAction Quarantine -MailboxIntelligenceQuarantineTag NoAccess -EnableOrganizationDomainsProtection $true -EnableTargetedDomainsProtection $true -TargetedDomainProtectionAction Quarantine -TargetedDomainQuarantineTag NoAccess -EnableTargetedUserProtection $true -TargetedUserProtectionAction Quarantine -TargetedUserQuarantineTag NoAccess
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-AntiPhishPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/new-antiphishpolicy).

This example updates the existing Human Resources anti-phishing policy to quarantine messages detected by targeted domain impersonation and targeted user impersonation, and assigns the custom quarantine policy named ContosoNoAccess to both detections.

```powershell
Set-AntiPhishPolicy -Identity "Human Resources" -EnableTargetedDomainsProtection $true -TargetedDomainProtectionAction Quarantine -TargetedDomainQuarantineTag ContosoNoAccess -EnableTargetedUserProtection $true -TargetedUserProtectionAction Quarantine -TargetedUserQuarantineTag ContosoNoAccess
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-AntiPhishPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/set-antiphishpolicy).

### Anti-malware policies

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal at [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Email & collaboration** > **Policies & rules** > **Threat policies** > **Anti-malware** in the **Policies** section. Or, to go directly to the **Anti-malware** page, use [https://security.microsoft.com/antimalwarev2](https://security.microsoft.com/antimalwarev2).
2. On the **Anti-malware** page, use either of the following methods:

   - Select an existing anti-malware policy by clicking anywhere in the row other than the check box next to the name. In the policy details flyout that opens, go to the **Protection settings** section, and then select **Edit protection settings**.
   - Select ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-create.png) **Create** to start the new anti-malware policy wizard and get to the **Protection settings** page.

3. On the **Protection settings** page or flyout, view or select a quarantine policy in the **Quarantine policy** box.

   Quarantine notifications are disabled in the policy named AdminOnlyAccessPolicy. To notify recipients that have messages quarantined as malware, create or use an existing quarantine policy where quarantine notifications are turned on. For instructions, see [Create quarantine policies in the Microsoft Defender portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-policies#step-1-create-quarantine-policies-in-the-microsoft-defender-portal).

   Users can't release their own messages quarantined as malware by anti-malware policies, regardless of how the quarantine policy is configured. If the policy is configured for users to release these quarantined messages, users are instead allowed to *request* the release of these quarantined messages.

   [![The Quarantine policy selections in an anti-malware policy.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/quarantine-tags-in-anti-malware-policies.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/quarantine-tags-in-anti-malware-policies.png#lightbox)

Full instructions for creating and modifying anti-malware policies are available in [Configure anti-malware policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-malware-policies-configure).

#### Anti-malware policies in PowerShell

If you'd rather use [Exchange Online PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell) to assign quarantine policies in anti-malware policies, use the following syntax to create or update an anti-malware policy and assign a custom quarantine policy to malware detections:

```powershell
<New-AntiMalwarePolicy -Name "<Unique name>" | Set-AntiMalwarePolicy -Identity "<Policy name>"> [-QuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>]
```

- When you create new anti-malware policies without using the *QuarantineTag* parameter, the default quarantine policy named AdminOnlyAccessPolicy is used.

  Users can't release their own messages quarantined as malware, regardless of how the quarantine policy is configured. If the policy is configured for users to release these quarantined messages, users are instead allowed to *request* the release of these quarantined messages.

  To see which quarantine policy is assigned to each existing anti-malware policy, run the following command:

  ```powershell
  Get-MalwareFilterPolicy | Format-Table Name,QuarantineTag
  ```

- A new anti-malware policy in PowerShell requires a malware filter policy using the **New-MalwareFilterPolicy** cmdlet \(settings\), and an exclusive malware filter rule using the **New-MalwareFilterRule** cmdlet \(recipient filters\). For instructions, see [Use Exchange Online PowerShell to configure anti-malware policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-malware-policies-configure#use-powershell-to-configure-anti-malware-policies).

This example creates an anti-malware policy named Research Department and assigns the ContosoNoAccess quarantine policy \(**No access** permissions\) to malware detections.

```powershell
New-MalwareFilterPolicy -Name "Research Department" -QuarantineTag ContosoNoAccess
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-MalwareFilterPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/new-malwarefilterpolicy).

This example updates the existing Human Resources anti-malware policy to use the ContosoNoAccess quarantine policy \(**No access** permissions\) for malware detections.

```powershell
Set-MalwareFilterPolicy -Identity "Human Resources" -QuarantineTag ContosoNoAccess
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-MalwareFilterPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/set-malwarefilterpolicy).

### Safe Attachments policies in Defender for Office 365

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal at [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Email & collaboration** > **Policies & rules** > **Threat policies** > **Safe Attachments** in the **Policies** section. Or, to go directly to the **Safe Attachments** page, use [https://security.microsoft.com/safeattachmentv2](https://security.microsoft.com/safeattachmentv2).
2. On the **Safe Attachments** page, use either of the following methods:

   - Select an existing Safe Attachments policy by clicking anywhere in the row other than the check box next to the name. In the policy details flyout that opens, select the **Edit settings** link in **Settings** section.
   - Select ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-create.png) **Create** to start the new Safe Attachments policy wizard and get to the **Settings** page.

3. On the **Settings** page or flyout, view or select a quarantine policy in the following boxes:

   - **Quarantine policy** in the **Safe Attachments unknown malware response** section: This quarantine policy applies to messages quarantined by Safe Attachments scanning.

     Users can't release their own messages quarantined as malware or phishing by Safe Attachments policies, regardless of how the quarantine policy is configured. If the policy is configured for users to release these quarantined messages, users are instead allowed to *request* the release of these quarantined messages.
   - **Quarantine policy** in the **Block messages containing encrypted attachments that could not be scanned** section \(available when you select **Block unscanned attachments**\): This quarantine policy applies to messages quarantined because they contain encrypted \(password-protected\) attachments that can't be scanned.


   [![The Quarantine policy selections in a Safe Attachments policy.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/quarantine-tags-in-safe-attachments-policies.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/quarantine-tags-in-safe-attachments-policies.png#lightbox)

Full instructions for creating and modifying Safe Attachments policies are described in [Set up Safe Attachments policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/safe-attachments-policies-configure).

#### Safe Attachments policies in PowerShell

If you'd rather use [Exchange Online PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell) to assign quarantine policies in Safe Attachments policies, use the following syntax to create or update a Safe Attachments policy and optionally assign a custom quarantine policy when messages are blocked or dynamically delivered, or when messages contain encrypted \(password-protected\) attachments that can't be scanned:

```powershell
<New-SafeAttachmentPolicy -Name "<Unique name>" | Set-SafeAttachmentPolicy -Identity "<Policy name>"> -Enable $true -Action <Block | DynamicDelivery> [-QuarantineTag <QuarantineTagName>] [-EnableBlockingEncryptedAttachments $true] [-QuarantineTagForBlockingEncryptedAttachments <QuarantineTagName>]
```

- The *Action* parameter values Block or DynamicDelivery can result in quarantined messages \(the value Allow doesn't quarantine messages\). The value of the *Action* parameter is meaningful only when the value of the *Enable* parameter is `$true`.
- When you create new Safe Attachments policies without using the *QuarantineTag* parameter, the default quarantine policy named AdminOnlyAccessPolicy is used for malware detections by Safe Attachments.

  Users can't release their own messages quarantined as malware, regardless of how the quarantine policy is configured. If the policy is configured for users to release these quarantined messages, users are instead allowed to *request* the release of these quarantined messages.

  To see which quarantine policy is assigned to each existing Safe Attachments policy, run the following command:

  ```powershell
  Get-SafeAttachmentPolicy | Format-List Name,Enable,Action,QuarantineTag
  ```

- When you use the *EnableBlockingEncryptedAttachments* parameter value `$true` \(the **Block unscanned attachments** setting\) without using the *QuarantineTagForBlockingEncryptedAttachments* parameter, the default quarantine policy named DefaultFullAccessWithNotificationPolicy is used for messages that are quarantined because they contain encrypted \(password-protected\) attachments that can't be scanned. This setting is meaningful only when the value of the *Action* parameter is `Block`.
- A new Safe Attachments policy in PowerShell requires a safe attachment policy using the **New-SafeAttachmentPolicy** cmdlet \(settings\), and an exclusive safe attachment rule using the **New-SafeAttachmentRule** cmdlet \(recipient filters\). For instructions, see [Use Exchange Online PowerShell to configure Safe Attachments policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/safe-attachments-policies-configure#use-exchange-online-powershell-to-configure-safe-attachments-policies).

This example creates a Safe Attachments policy named Research Department that blocks detected messages and assigns the NoAccess quarantine policy \(**No access** permissions\) to quarantined messages.

```powershell
New-SafeAttachmentPolicy -Name "Research Department" -Enable $true -Action Block -QuarantineTag NoAccess
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-SafeAttachmentPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/new-safeattachmentpolicy).

This example modifies the existing safe attachment policy named Human Resources to use the custom quarantine policy named ContosoNoAccess that assigns **No access** permissions.

```powershell
Set-SafeAttachmentPolicy -Identity "Human Resources" -QuarantineTag ContosoNoAccess
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-SafeAttachmentPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/set-safeattachmentpolicy).

## Configure global quarantine notification settings in the Microsoft Defender portal

The global settings for quarantine policies allow you to customize the quarantine notifications sent to recipients of quarantined messages if quarantine notifications are enabled in the quarantine policy. For more information about quarantine notifications, see [Quarantine notifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-quarantine-notifications).

### Customize quarantine notifications for different languages

The message body of quarantine notifications is already localized based on the language setting of the recipient's cloud-based mailbox.

You can use the procedures in this section to customize the **Sender display name**, **Subject**, and **Disclaimer** values that are used in quarantine notifications based on the language setting of the recipient's cloud-based mailbox:

- The **Sender display name** as shown in the following screenshot:

  [![A customized sender display name in a quarantine notification.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/quarantine-tags-esn-customization-display-name.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/quarantine-tags-esn-customization-display-name.png#lightbox)
- The **Subject** field of quarantine notification messages.
- The **Disclaimer** text added to the bottom of quarantine notifications \(max. 200 characters\). The localized text, **A disclaimer from your organization:** is always included first, followed by the text you specify as shown in the following screenshot:

[![A custom disclaimer at the bottom of a quarantine notification.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/quarantine-tags-esn-customization-disclaimer.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/quarantine-tags-esn-customization-disclaimer.png#lightbox)

Tip

Quarantine notifications aren't localized for on-premises mailboxes.

A custom quarantine notification for a specific language is shown to users only when their mailbox language matches the language in the custom quarantine notification.

The value **English\_USA** applies only to US English clients. The value **English\_Great Britain** applies to all other English clients \(Great Britain, Canada, Australia, etc.\).

The languages **Norwegian** and **Norwegian \(Nynorsk\)** are available. Norwegian \(Bokmål\) isn't available.

To create customized quarantine notifications for up to three languages, do the following steps:

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal at [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Email & collaboration** > **Policies & rules** > **Threat policies** > **Quarantine policies** in the **Rules** section. Or, to go directly to the **Quarantine policies** page, use [https://security.microsoft.com/quarantinePolicies](https://security.microsoft.com/quarantinePolicies).
2. On the **Quarantine policies** page, select ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-gear.png) **Global settings**.
3. In the **Quarantine notification settings** flyout that opens, do the following steps:

   1. Select the language from the **Choose language** box. The default value is **English\_USA**.

      Although this box isn't the first setting, you need to configure it first. If you enter values in the **Sender display name**, **Subject**, or **Disclaimer** boxes before you select the language, those values disappear.
   2. After you select the language, enter values for **Sender display name**, **Subject**, and **Disclaimer**. The values must be unique for each language. If you try to reuse a value in a different language, you get an error when you select **Save**.
   3. Select the **Add** button near the **Choose language** box.

      After you select **Add**, the configured settings for the language appear in the **Click the language to show the previously configured settings** box. To reload the settings, click on the language name. To remove the language, select ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-remove-selection.png) .

      [![The selected languages in the global quarantine notification settings of quarantine policies.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/quarantine-tags-esn-customization-selected-languages.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/quarantine-tags-esn-customization-selected-languages.png#lightbox)
   4. Repeat the previous steps to create a maximum of three customized quarantine notifications based on the recipient's language.

4. When you're finished on the **Quarantine notifications** flyout, select **Save**.

   [![Quarantine notification settings flyout in the Microsoft Defender portal.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/mdo-quarantine-policy-quarantine-notification-settings.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/mdo-quarantine-policy-quarantine-notification-settings.png#lightbox)

### Customize all quarantine notifications

Even if you don't customize quarantine notifications for different languages, settings are available in the **Quarantine notifications flyout** to customize all quarantine notifications. Or, you can configure the settings before, during, or after you customize quarantine notifications for different languages \(these settings apply to all languages\):

- **Specify sender address**: Select an existing user for the sender email address of quarantine notifications. The default sender is `quarantine@messaging.microsoft.com`.
- **Use my company logo**: Select this option to replace the default Microsoft logo that's used at the top of quarantine notifications. Before you do this step, you need to follow the instructions in [Customize the Microsoft 365 theme for your organization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/Microsoft-365/admin/setup/customize-your-organization-theme) to upload your custom logo.

  Tip

  PNG or JPEG logos are the most compatible in quarantine notifications in all versions of Outlook. For the best compatibility with SVG logos in quarantine notifications, use a URL link to the SVG logo instead of directly uploading the SVG file when you customize the Microsoft 365 theme.

  A custom logo in a quarantine notification is shown in the following screenshot:

  [![A custom logo in a quarantine notification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/quarantine-tags-esn-customization-logo.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/quarantine-tags-esn-customization-logo.png#lightbox)
- **Send end-user spam notification every \(days\)**: Select the frequency for quarantine notifications. You can select **Within 4 hours**, **Daily**, or **Weekly**.

  Tip

  If you select every four hours, and a message is quarantined *just after* the last notification generation, the recipient will receive the quarantine notification *slightly more than* four hours later.

When you're finished in the **Quarantine notification settings** flyout, select **Save**.

### Use PowerShell to configure global quarantine notification settings

If you'd rather use [Exchange Online PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell) to configure global quarantine notification settings, use the following syntax:

```powershell
Get-QuarantinePolicy -QuarantinePolicyType GlobalQuarantinePolicy | Set-QuarantinePolicy -MultiLanguageSetting ('Language1','Language2','Language3') -MultiLanguageCustomDisclaimer ('Language1 Disclaimer','Language2 Disclaimer','Language3 Disclaimer') -ESNCustomSubject ('Language1 Subject','Language2 Subject','Language3 Subject') -MultiLanguageSenderName ('Language1 Sender Display Name','Language2 Sender Display Name','Language3 Sender Display Name') [-EndUserSpamNotificationCustomFromAddress <InternalUserEmailAddress>] [-OrganizationBrandingEnabled <$true | $false>] [-EndUserSpamNotificationFrequency <04:00:00 | 1.00:00:00 | 7.00:00:00>]
```

- You can specify a maximum of three available languages. The value Default is en-US. The value English is everything else \(en-GB, en-CA, en-AU, etc.\).
- For each language, you need to specify unique *MultiLanguageCustomDisclaimer*, *ESNCustomSubject*, and *MultiLanguageSenderName* values.
- If any of the text values contain quotation marks, you need to escape the quotation mark with an extra quotation mark. For example, change `d'assistance` to `d''assistance`.

This example configures the following settings:

- Customized quarantine notifications for US English and Spanish.
- The quarantine notification sender's email address is set to `michelle@contoso.onmicrosoft.com`.

```powershell
Get-QuarantinePolicy -QuarantinePolicyType GlobalQuarantinePolicy | Set-QuarantinePolicy -MultiLanguageSetting ('Default','Spanish') -MultiLanguageCustomDisclaimer ('For more information, contact the Help Desk.','Para obtener más información, comuníquese con la mesa de ayuda.') -ESNCustomSubject ('You have quarantined messages','Tienes mensajes en cuarentena') -MultiLanguageSenderName ('Contoso administrator','Administradora de contoso') -EndUserSpamNotificationCustomFromAddress michelle@contoso.onmicrosoft.com
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-QuarantinePolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/set-quarantinepolicy).

## View quarantine policies in the Microsoft Defender portal

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal at [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Email & collaboration** > **Policies & rules** > **Threat policies** > **Quarantine policies** in the **Rules** section. Or, to go directly to the **Quarantine policies** page, use [https://security.microsoft.com/quarantinePolicies](https://security.microsoft.com/quarantinePolicies).
2. The **Quarantine policies** page shows the list of policies by **Policy name** and **Last updated** date/time.
3. To view the settings of default or custom quarantine policies, select the policy by clicking anywhere in the row other than the check box next to the name. Details are available in the flyout that opens.
4. To view the global settings, select **Global settings**

### View quarantine policies in PowerShell

If you'd rather use PowerShell to view quarantine policies, do any of the following steps:

- To view a summary list of all default or custom quarantine policies, run the following command:

  ```powershell
  Get-QuarantinePolicy | Format-Table Name
  ```

- To view the settings of default or custom quarantine policies, replace <QuarantinePolicyName> with the name of the quarantine policy, and run the following command:

  ```powershell
  Get-QuarantinePolicy -Identity "<QuarantinePolicyName>"
  ```

- To view the global settings for quarantine notifications, run the following command:

  ```powershell
  Get-QuarantinePolicy -QuarantinePolicyType GlobalQuarantinePolicy
  ```

Important

The *PermissionTo\** properties returned by **Get-QuarantineMessage** reflect the permissions of the user who runs the cmdlet. For example, admins who have permission to release quarantined messages might see the value `True` for the *PermissionToRelease*, *PermissionToAllowSender*, and *PermissionToDownload* properties, even when the quarantine policy assigned to the message is `AdminOnlyAccessPolicy`. These values don't represent the actions available to message recipients. To view the end-user permissions configured in a quarantine policy, use **Get-QuarantinePolicy**.

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-QuarantinePolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/get-quarantinepolicy).

## Modify quarantine policies in the Microsoft Defender portal

Note

Permissions and notification settings in default quarantine policies are read only \(aren't modifiable\).

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal at [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Email & collaboration** > **Policies & rules** > **Threat policies** > **Quarantine policies** in the **Rules** section. Or, to go directly to the **Quarantine policies** page, use [https://security.microsoft.com/quarantinePolicies](https://security.microsoft.com/quarantinePolicies).
2. On the **Quarantine policies** page, select the policy by clicking the check box next to the name.
3. Select the ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-edit.png) **Edit policy** action that appears.

The policy wizard opens with the settings and values of the selected quarantine policy. The steps are virtually the same as described in the [Create quarantine policies in the Microsoft Defender portal](#step-1-create-quarantine-policies-in-the-microsoft-defender-portal) section. The main difference is: you can't rename an existing policy.

### Modify quarantine policies in PowerShell

If you'd rather use PowerShell to modify a custom quarantine policy, replace <QuarantinePolicyName> with the name of the quarantine policy, and use the following syntax:

```powershell
Set-QuarantinePolicy -Identity "<QuarantinePolicyName>" [Settings]
```

The available settings are the same as described in [Create quarantine policies in the Microsoft Defender portal](#step-1-create-quarantine-policies-in-the-microsoft-defender-portal) and [Create quarantine policies in PowerShell](#create-quarantine-policies-in-powershell).

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-QuarantinePolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/set-quarantinepolicy).

## Remove quarantine policies in the Microsoft Defender portal

Note

Don't remove a quarantine policy until you verify that it isn't being used. For example, run the following command in PowerShell:

> ```powershell
> Write-Output -InputObject "Anti-spam policies",("-"*25);Get-HostedContentFilterPolicy | Format-List Name,*QuarantineTag; Write-Output -InputObject "Anti-phishing policies",("-"*25);Get-AntiPhishPolicy | Format-List Name,*QuarantineTag; Write-Output -InputObject "Anti-malware policies",("-"*25);Get-MalwareFilterPolicy | Format-List Name,QuarantineTag; Write-Output -InputObject "Safe Attachments policies",("-"*25);Get-SafeAttachmentPolicy | Format-List Name,QuarantineTag
> ```
> 
> If the quarantine policy is being used, [replace the assigned quarantine policy](#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features) before you remove it to avoid the potential disruption in quarantine notifications.
> 
> You can't remove the default quarantine policies named AdminOnlyAccessPolicy, DefaultFullAccessPolicy, or DefaultFullAccessWithNotificationPolicy.

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal at [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Email & collaboration** > **Policies & rules** > **Threat policies** > **Quarantine policies** in the **Rules** section. Or, to go directly to the **Quarantine policies** page, use [https://security.microsoft.com/quarantinePolicies](https://security.microsoft.com/quarantinePolicies).
2. On the **Quarantine policies** page, select the policy by clicking the check box next to the name.
3. Select the ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-delete.png) **Delete policy** action that appears.
4. Select **Remove policy** in the confirmation dialog.

### Remove quarantine policies in PowerShell

If you'd rather use PowerShell to remove a custom quarantine policy, replace <QuarantinePolicyName> with the name of the quarantine policy, and run the following command:

```powershell
Remove-QuarantinePolicy -Identity "<QuarantinePolicyName>"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Remove-QuarantinePolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/remove-quarantinepolicy).

## System alerts for quarantine release requests

By default, the default alert policy named **User requested to release a quarantined message** automatically generates an informational alert and sends notification to Organization Management \(global administrator\) whenever a user requests the release of a quarantined message:

Admins can customize the email notification recipients or create a custom alert policy for more options.

For more information about alert policies, see [Alert policies in the Microsoft Defender portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/alert-policies-defender-portal).

Note

Audit logging must be enabled in order to receive notifications for quarantine release requests \(it's on by default\). For instructions on how to turn auditing on or off, see [Turn auditing on or off](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/audit-log-enable-disable).

## Appendix: Quarantine policy anatomy and permissions

### Anatomy of a quarantine policy

A quarantine policy contains *permissions* that are combined into *preset permission groups*. The preset permissions groups are:

- No access
- Limited access
- Full access

By design, *default quarantine policies* enforce historical user capabilities on quarantined messages, and are automatically assigned to actions in [supported protection features](#step-2-assign-a-quarantine-policy-to-supported-features) that quarantine messages.

The default quarantine policies are:

- AdminOnlyAccessPolicy
- DefaultFullAccessPolicy
- DefaultFullAccessWithNotificationPolicy
- NotificationEnabledPolicy \(in some organizations\)

Quarantine policies also control whether users receive *quarantine notifications* about messages that were quarantined instead of delivered to them. Quarantine notifications do two things:

- Inform the user that the message is in quarantine.
- Allow users to view and take action on the quarantined message from the quarantine notification. Permissions control what the user can do in the quarantine notification as described in the [Quarantine policy permission details](#quarantine-policy-permission-details) section.

Note

Permissions and notification settings in default quarantine policies are read only \(aren't modifiable\).

The relationship between permissions, permissions groups, and the default quarantine policies are described in the following tables:

| Permission | No access | Limited access | Full access |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| \(*PermissionToViewHeader*\)¹ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| **Allow sender** \(*PermissionToAllowSender*\) |  | ✔ | ✔ |
| **Block sender** \(*PermissionToBlockSender*\) |  |  |  |
| **Delete** \(*PermissionToDelete*\) |  | ✔ | ✔ |
| **Preview** \(*PermissionToPreview*\)² |  | ✔ | ✔ |
| **Allow recipients to release a message from quarantine** \(*PermissionToRelease*\)³ |  |  | ✔ |
| **Allow recipients to request a message to be released from quarantine** \(*PermissionToRequestRelease*\) |  | ✔ |  |

| Default quarantine policy | Permission group used | Quarantine notifications enabled? |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| AdminOnlyAccessPolicy | No access | No |
| DefaultFullAccessPolicy | Full access | No |
| DefaultFullAccessWithNotificationPolicy⁴ | Full access | Yes |
| NotificationEnabledPolicy⁵ | Full access | Yes |

¹ This permission isn't available in the Defender portal. Turning off the permission in PowerShell doesn't affect the availability of the ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-view-message-headers.png) **View message header** action on quarantined messages. If the message is visible to a user in quarantine, **View message header** is always available for the message.

² The **Preview** permission is unrelated to the **Review message** action that's available in quarantine notifications.

³ **Allow recipients to release a message from quarantine** isn't honored for messages that were quarantined as **malware** by anti-malware policies or Safe Attachments policies, or as **high confidence phishing** by anti-spam policies.

⁴ This policy is used in [preset security policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/preset-security-policies) to enable quarantine notifications instead of the policy named DefaultFullAccessPolicy where notifications are turned off.

⁵ Your organization might not have the policy named NotificationEnabledPolicy. For details, see [Full access permissions and quarantine notifications](#full-access-permissions-and-quarantine-notifications).

#### Full access permissions and quarantine notifications

The default quarantine policy named DefaultFullAccessPolicy duplicates the historical *permissions* for less harmful quarantined messages, but *quarantine notifications* aren't turned on in the quarantine policy. Where DefaultFullAccessPolicy is used by default is described in the feature tables in [Recommended email and collaboration threat policy settings for cloud organizations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365).

To give organizations the permissions of DefaultFullAccessPolicy with quarantine notifications turned on, we selectively included a default policy named NotificationEnabledPolicy based on the following criteria:

- The organization existed before the introduction of quarantine policies \(July-August 2021\).

  **and**
- The **Enable end-user spam notifications** setting was turned on in one or more [anti-spam policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-spam-policies-configure). Before the introduction of quarantine policies, this setting determined whether users received notifications about their quarantined messages.

Newer organizations or older organizations that never turned on end-user spam notifications don't have the policy named NotificationEnabledPolicy.

To give users **Full access** permissions *and* quarantine notifications, organizations that don't have the NotificationEnabledPolicy policy have the following options:

- Use the default policy named DefaultFullAccessWithNotificationPolicy.
- Create and use custom quarantine policies with **Full access** permissions and quarantine notifications turned on.

### Quarantine policy permission details

The following sections describe the effects of preset permission groups and individual permissions for users in quarantined messages and in quarantine notifications.

Note

Quarantine notifications are turned on only in the default quarantine policies named DefaultFullAccessWithNotificationPolicy or \([if your organization is old enough](#full-access-permissions-and-quarantine-notifications)\) NotificationEnabledPolicy.

#### Preset permissions groups

The individual permissions included in preset permission groups are described in [Anatomy of a quarantine policy](#anatomy-of-a-quarantine-policy).

##### No access

The effect of **No access** permissions \(admin only access\) on user capabilities depends on the state of quarantine notifications in the quarantine policy:

- **Quarantine notifications turned off**:

  - **On the Quarantine page**: Quarantined messages aren't visible to users.
  - **In quarantine notifications**: Users don't receive quarantine notifications for the messages.

- **Quarantine notifications turned on**:

  - **On the Quarantine page**: Quarantined messages are visible to users, but the only available action is ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-view-message-headers.png) [View message headers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#view-email-message-headers).
  - **In quarantine notifications**: Users receive quarantine notifications, but the only available action is **Review message**.

Tip

- To enable quarantine notifications while maintaining restricted access, [create a custom quarantine policy](#step-1-create-quarantine-policies-in-the-microsoft-defender-portal) with the following settings:

  - **Recipient message access** page: Select **Set specific access \(Advanced\)**, but leave **Select release action preference** and **Select additional actions recipients can take on quarantined messages** blank/unselected \(equivalent to the value 0 for the *EndUserQuarantinePermissionsValue* parameter on the **New-QuarantinePolicy** cmdlet [in PowerShell](#create-quarantine-policies-in-powershell)\).
  - **Quarantine notification** page: Select **Enable** and then select **Don't include quarantined messages from blocked sender addresses** \(default\) or **Include quarantined messages from blocked sender addresses**.

##### Limited access

If the quarantine policy assigns **Limited access** permissions, users get the following capabilities:

- **On the Quarantine page and in the message details in quarantine**: The following actions are available:

  - ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-request-release.png) [Request release](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#request-the-release-of-quarantined-email) \(the difference from **Full access** permissions\)
  - ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-delete.png) [Delete](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#delete-email-from-quarantine)
  - ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-preview-message.png) [Preview message](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#preview-email-from-quarantine)
  - ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-view-message-headers.png) [View message headers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#view-email-message-headers)
  - ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-allow-sender.png) [Allow sender](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#allow-email-senders-from-quarantine)

- **In quarantine notifications**: The following actions are available:

  - **Review message**
  - **Request release** \(the difference from **Full access** permissions\)

##### Full access

If the quarantine policy assigns **Full access** permissions \(all available permissions\), users get the following capabilities:

- **On the Quarantine page and in the message details in quarantine**: The following actions are available:

  - ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-check-mark.png) [Release](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#release-quarantined-email) \(the difference from **Limited access** permissions\)
  - ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-delete.png) [Delete](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#delete-email-from-quarantine)
  - ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-preview-message.png) [Preview message](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#preview-email-from-quarantine)
  - ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-view-message-headers.png) [View message headers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#view-email-message-headers)
  - ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-allow-sender.png) [Allow sender](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#allow-email-senders-from-quarantine)

- **In quarantine notifications**: The following actions are available:

  - **Review message**
  - **Release** \(the difference from **Limited access** permissions\)

#### Individual permissions

##### Allow sender permission

The **Allow sender** permission \(*PermissionToAllowSender*\) allows users to add the message sender to the Safe Senders list in their mailbox.

If the **Allow sender** permission is enabled:

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-allow-sender.png)

- ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-allow-sender.png) [Allow sender](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#allow-email-senders-from-quarantine) is available on the **Quarantine** page and in the message details in quarantine.

If the **Allow sender** permission is disabled, users can't allow senders from quarantine \(the action isn't available\).

For more information about the Safe Senders list, see [Add recipients of my email messages to the Safe Senders List](https://support.microsoft.com/office/be1baea0-beab-4a30-b968-9004332336ce) and [Use Exchange Online PowerShell to configure the safelist collection on a mailbox](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/configure-junk-email-settings-on-exo-mailboxes#use-exchange-online-powershell-to-configure-the-safelist-collection-on-a-mailbox).

##### Block sender permission

The **Block sender** permission \(*PermissionToBlockSender*\) allows users to add the message sender to the Blocked Senders list in their mailbox.

If the **Block sender** permission is enabled:

- ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-block-sender.png) [Block sender](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#block-email-senders-from-quarantine) is available on the **Quarantine** page and in the message details in quarantine.
- **Blocked sender** is available in quarantine notifications.

  For this permission to work correctly in quarantine notifications, users need to be enabled for remote PowerShell. For instructions, see [Enable or disable access to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/disable-access-to-exchange-online-powershell).

If the **Block sender** permission is disabled, users can't block senders from quarantine or in quarantine notifications \(the action isn't available\).

For more information about the Blocked Senders list, see [Block messages from someone](https://support.microsoft.com/office/274ae301-5db2-4aad-be21-25413cede077#__toc304379667) and [Use Exchange Online PowerShell to configure the safelist collection on a mailbox](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/configure-junk-email-settings-on-exo-mailboxes#use-exchange-online-powershell-to-configure-the-safelist-collection-on-a-mailbox).

Tip

The organization can still receive mail from the blocked sender. The policy precedence as described in [User allows and blocks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/how-policies-and-protections-are-combined#user-allows-and-blocks) determines whether messages from the sender are delivered to the Junk Email folder or to quarantine. To delete messages from the blocked sender upon arrival, use [mail flow rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rules) \(also known as transport rules\) to **Block the message**.

##### Delete permission

The **Delete** permission \(*PermissionToDelete*\) allows users to delete their own messages from quarantine \(messages where they're a recipient\).

If the **Delete** permission is enabled:

- ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-delete.png) [Delete](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#delete-email-from-quarantine) is available on the **Quarantine** page and in the message details in quarantine.
- No effect in quarantine notifications. Deleting a quarantined message from the quarantine notification isn't possible.

If the **Delete** permission is disabled, users can't delete their own messages from quarantine \(the action isn't available\).

Tip

Admins can find out who deleted a quarantined message by searching the admin audit log. For instructions, see [Find who deleted a quarantined message](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-admin-manage-messages-files#find-who-deleted-a-quarantined-message). Admins can use [message trace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/message-trace-defender-portal) to find out what happened to a released message if the original recipient can't find it.

##### Preview permission

The **Preview** permission \(*PermissionToPreview*\) allows users to preview their messages in quarantine.

If the **Preview** permission is enabled:

- ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-preview-message.png) [Preview message](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#preview-email-from-quarantine) is available on the **Quarantine** page and in the message details in quarantine.
- No effect in quarantine notifications. Previewing a quarantined message from the quarantine notification isn't possible. The **Review message** action in quarantine notifications takes users to the details flyout of the message in quarantine where they can preview the message.

If the **Preview** permission is disabled, users can't preview their own messages in quarantine \(the action isn't available\).

##### Allow recipients to release a message from quarantine permission

Note

As explained previously, this permission isn't honored in the following scenarios, regardless of how the quarantine policy is configured:

- Messages quarantined as malware by anti-malware policies.
- Messages quarantined as malware or phishing by Safe Attachments policies.
- Messages quarantined as high confidence phishing by anti-spam policies.

If the policy is configured for users to release these quarantined messages, users are instead allowed to *request* the release of these quarantined messages.

The **Allow recipients to release a message from quarantine** permission \(*PermissionToRelease*\) allows users to release their own quarantined messages without admin approval.

If the **Allow recipients to release a message from quarantine** permission is enabled:

- ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-check-mark.png) [Release](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#release-quarantined-email) is available on the **Quarantine** page and in the message details in quarantine.
- **Release** is available in quarantine notifications.

If the **Allow recipients to release a message from quarantine** permission is disabled, users can't release their own messages from quarantine or in quarantine notifications \(the action isn't available\).

##### Allow recipients to request a message to be released from quarantine permission

The **Allow recipients to request a message to be released from quarantine** permission \(*PermissionToRequestRelease*\) allows users to *request* the release of their quarantined messages. Messages are released only after an admin [approves the request](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-admin-manage-messages-files#approve-or-deny-release-requests-from-users-for-quarantined-email).

If the **Allow recipients to request a message to be released from quarantine** permission is enabled:

- ![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/defender-portal-icon-request-release.png) [Request release](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/quarantine-end-user#request-the-release-of-quarantined-email) is available on the **Quarantine** page and in the message details in quarantine.
- **Request release** is available in quarantine notifications.

If the **Allow recipients to request a message to be released from quarantine** permission is disabled, users can't request the release of their own messages from quarantine or in quarantine notifications \(the action isn't available\).
