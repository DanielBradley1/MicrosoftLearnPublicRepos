### I have Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or Plan 2 paid license. Why can I not see the usage card?

If you have at least one Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 or Plan 2 license, but you're still unable to see the card because of one of the following reasons:

- You don't have the required role to be able to view the card.
- Your organization had no active usage in the past 28 days.

### What does Collecting license and usage data status mean?

If you see **Collecting license and usage data** status in your usage card, it means Microsoft is still collecting your current licensing and usage data. When it's available, you can see the full usage card and other details.

[![Screenshot of the usage card showing the collecting data status.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/usage-card-collecting-data.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/media/usage-card-collecting-data.png#lightbox)

### Why does the Usage card show an overage even though you don't have Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 and no usage of SecOps capabilities?

The usage card shows usage of both Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 and Plan 2. If you don't have any Plan 2 licenses, the usage is coming from Plan 1 features \(for example, Safe Links or Safe Attachments\). You can fix this overage by purchasing more Plan 1 licenses.
