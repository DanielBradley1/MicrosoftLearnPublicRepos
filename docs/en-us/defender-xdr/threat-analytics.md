# Threat analytics in Microsoft Defender

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft Defender XDR

Important

Some information in this article relates to a prereleased product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

Threat analytics is an in-product threat intelligence solution from expert Microsoft security researchers. It helps security teams stay efficient while facing emerging threats, such as:

- Active threat actors and their campaigns
- Popular and new attack techniques
- Critical vulnerabilities
- Common attack surfaces
- Prevalent malware

In addition to Microsoft first-party intelligence, threat analytics also surfaces open-source intelligence \(OSINT\) articles—curated threat reports derived from publicly available sources—giving security teams a unified view of both Microsoft and external threat intelligence in a single experience.

You can access threat analytics from the upper left-hand side of Microsoft Defender portal's navigation bar, or from a dedicated dashboard card that shows the top threats to your organization, both in terms of known impact and your exposure.

[![Screenshot of the threat analytics landing page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/media/threat-analytics/ta_inlandingpage_mtp.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/media/threat-analytics/ta_inlandingpage_mtp.png#lightbox)

Getting visibility on active or ongoing campaigns and knowing what to do through threat analytics can help equip your security operations team with informed decisions.

With more sophisticated adversaries and new threats emerging frequently and prevalently, it's critical to be able to quickly:

- Identify and react to emerging threats
- Learn if you're currently under attack
- Assess the impact of the threat to your assets
- Review your resilience against or exposure to the threats
- Identify the mitigation, recovery, or prevention actions you can take to stop or contain the threats

Each report provides an analysis of a tracked threat and extensive guidance on how to defend against that threat. It also incorporates data from your network, indicating whether the threat is active and if you have applicable protections in place.

## Required roles and permissions

To access Threat analytics in the Defender portal, you need a license for at least one Microsoft Defender product. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/prerequisites).

Note

The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P1 license is an exception to this prerequisite and doesn't grant Threat analytics access.

Microsoft Sentinel SIEM customers have access to certain Threat analytics sections or tabs only. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/threat-analytics-sentinel)

The following roles and permissions are also required to access Threat analytics:

- **Security data basics \(read\)**—to view threat analytics report, related incidents and alerts, and impacted assets
- **Vulnerability management \(read\)** and **Exposure Management \(read\)**—to see related exposure data and recommended actions

By default, access to services available in the Defender portal is managed collectively using [Microsoft Entra global roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/m365d-permissions). If you need greater flexibility and control over access to specific product data, and aren't yet using the [Microsoft Defender unified role-based access control \(RBAC\)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/manage-rbac) for centralized permissions management, we recommend creating custom roles for each service. [Learn more about creating custom roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/custom-roles)

Important

You have visibility to all threat analytics reports even if you have just one of the supported products. However, you need each product and role to see that product's specific incidents, assets, exposure, and recommended actions associated with the threat.

## View the threat analytics dashboard

The threat analytics dashboard \([security.microsoft.com/threatanalytics3](https://security.microsoft.com/threatanalytics3)\) highlights the reports that are most relevant to your organization. It summarizes the threats in the following sections:

- **Latest threats**—lists the most recently published or updated threat reports, along with the number of active and resolved alerts.
- **High-impact threats**—lists the threats that have the highest impact to your organization. This section lists threats with the highest number of active and resolved alerts first.
- **Highest exposure threats**—lists threats to which your organization has the highest exposure. Your exposure level to a threat is calculated using two pieces of information: how severe the vulnerabilities associated with the threat are, and how many devices in your organization could be exploited by those vulnerabilities.

[![Screenshot of the threat analytics dashboard,](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/media/threat-analytics/ta_dashboard_mtp.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/media/threat-analytics/ta_dashboard_mtp.png#lightbox)

Select a threat from the dashboard to view the report for that threat. You can also select the **Search** field to key in a keyword that's related to the threat analytics report that you'd like to read.

### View reports by category

You can filter the threat report list and view the most relevant reports according to the following options:

- **Threat tags**—assist you in viewing the most relevant reports according to a specific threat category. For example, the **Ransomware** tag includes all reports related to ransomware.

  The Microsoft Threat Intelligence team adds threat tags to each threat report. The following threat tags are currently available:

  - Ransomware
  - Phishing
  - Activity group
  - Vulnerability

- **Category**—assists you in viewing the most relevant reports according to a specific report type. For example, the **Actor** category includes all threat actor profiles, and the **OSINT** category surfaces open-source intelligence articles from external sources. [Learn more about the different analyst report types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/threat-analytics-analyst-reports#know-the-different-analyst-report-types)

These filters assist you in efficiently reviewing the threat report list. For example, you can view all threat reports related to the ransomware category, or threat reports that involve vulnerabilities.

Categories are presented at the top of the threat analytics page. Counters show the number of available reports under each category.

### Indicators: View specific infrastructure and evidence behind the threat \(preview\)

The **Indicators** tab provides a list of all indicators of compromise \(IOCs\) associated with the threat. Microsoft researchers update these IOCs in real time as they find new evidence related to the threat. This information helps your security operations center \(SOC\) and threat intelligence analysts with remediation and proactive hunting. The list also retains expired IOCs, so you can investigate past threats and understand their impact in your environment.

[![Screenshot of the Indicators tab in a threat analytics report.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/media/ta-indicators/indicators-full.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/media/ta-indicators/indicators-full.png#lightbox)

Important

Only verified customers can access the information in the **Indicators** tab. If you don't have access to this information, you need to verify your tenant. [Learn more about getting access to IOCs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/threat-analytics-indicators)

## Stay updated with the latest reports and threat intelligence

Threat analytics leverages and integrates various Microsoft Defender and [Microsoft Security Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/microsoft-security-copilot) features to keep you and your SOC team updated whenever a new report or new piece of threat intelligence relevant to your environment becomes available.

### Set up the Threat Intelligence Briefing Agent

Set up the Threat Intelligence Briefing Agent to get timely, relevant threat intelligence reports with detailed technical analysis based on the latest threat actor activity and both internal and external vulnerability exposure. The agent correlates Microsoft threat data and customer signals to add critical context to threat information in a matter of minutes, saving analyst teams hours or even days spent on intelligence gathering and correlation.

Once deployed, the Threat Intelligence Briefing Agent appears as a banner at the top of the Threat analytics page.

[![Screenshot of the Threat Intelligence Briefing Agent banner on top of the Threat analytics page.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/media/ti-briefing-agent/agent.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/media/ti-briefing-agent/agent.png#lightbox)

[Learn more about the Threat Intelligence Briefing Agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/threat-intel-briefing-agent-defender)

### Set up custom detections and link them to Threat analytics reports

Set up [custom detection rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/custom-detection-rules#2-create-new-rule-and-provide-alert-details) and link them to Threat analytics reports. If these rules get triggered and an alert generates an incident, the report shows up in that incident and the incident appears under the **Related incidents** tab, just like any other Microsoft-defined detection.

[![Screenshot of custom detection setup page with Threat analytics option highlighted.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/media/threat-analytics/ta-custom-detection.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/media/threat-analytics/ta-custom-detection.png#lightbox)

### Set up email notifications for report updates

Set up email notifications that send you updates on Threat analytics reports. To create email notifications, follow the steps in [get email notifications for Threat analytics updates in Microsoft Defender](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/m365d-threat-analytics-notifications).

## Other report details and limitations

When you review the threat analytics data, consider the following factors:

- The checklist in the **Recommended actions** tab only displays recommendations tracked in [Microsoft Secure Score](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/microsoft-secure-score). Check the **Analyst report** tab for more recommended actions that aren't tracked in Secure Score.
- The recommended actions don't guarantee complete resilience and only reflect the best possible actions needed to improve it.
- Antivirus-related statistics are based on Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings.
- The **Misconfigured devices** column in the main Threat analytics page shows the number of devices affected by a threat when the threat's related recommended actions aren't turned on. However, if Microsoft researchers don't link any recommended actions, the **Misconfigured devices** column shows the status *Not available*.
- The **Vulnerable devices** column in the main Threat analytics page shows the number of devices running software that are vulnerable to any of the vulnerabilities linked to the threat. However, if Microsoft researchers don't link any vulnerabilities, the **Vulnerable devices** column shows the status *Not available*.
