# How Defender for Cloud Apps helps protect your Salesforce environment

As a major CRM cloud provider, Salesforce incorporates large amounts of sensitive information about customers, pricing playbooks, and major deals inside your organization. Being a business-critical app, people inside your organization and others outside of it \(such as partners and contractors\) access and use Salesforce for various purposes. In many cases, a large proportion of your users accessing Salesforce have low awareness of security and might put your sensitive information at risk by unintentionally sharing it. In other instances, malicious actors might gain access to your most sensitive customer-related assets.

Connecting Salesforce to Defender for Cloud Apps gives you improved insights into your users' activities, provides threat detection using machine learning based anomaly detections and information protection detections \(such as detecting external information sharing\). Defender for Cloud Apps also enables automated remediation controls, and detects threats from enabled third-party apps in your organization. Before you begin, review the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) for connecting Salesforce to Defender for Cloud Apps.

Use this app connector to access SaaS Security Posture Management \(SSPM\) features, via security controls reflected in Microsoft Secure Score. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-secure-score).

## Connect Salesforce to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

Use the following prerequisites and steps to connect Salesforce to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.

### Prerequisites

SaaS security posture management \(SSPM\) doesn't require Salesforce Shield. For all other integrations, make sure that Salesforce Shield is available for your Salesforce instance.

Use the following instructions to connect Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to your existing Salesforce account using the app connector API. The Salesforce app connector gives you visibility into and control over Salesforce use.

Use this app connector to access SaaS Security Posture Management \(SSPM\) features, via security controls reflected in Microsoft Secure Score. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-secure-score).

- Install and authorize the Salesforce Connected App in the target Salesforce org before you start the connection process. Salesforce enforces usage restrictions on Connected Apps. For more information, see [Prepare for Connected App Usage Restrictions Change](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=005132365&type=1).
- Assign the **Approve Uninstalled Connected Apps** permission to the Salesforce service account used to connect Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. Salesforce requires this permission to connect third-party apps via OAuth.
- Make sure that the Salesforce account is assigned to one of the following editions, which support REST API access:

  - Performance
  - Enterprise
  - Unlimited
  - Developer
  - Professional. REST API must be added to the Professional edition separately.

### Configure Salesforce

Perform the following steps in Salesforce before connecting the app:

1. In your Salesforce account, create a dedicated service admin account for Defender for Cloud Apps.
2. Create a new profile for the Defender for Cloud Apps service account. Use this profile to configure the App connector.
3. Make sure that the service account profile includes the following permissions:

   - **API Enabled**
   - **View All Data**
   - **Manage Salesforce CRM Content**
   - **Manage Users**
   - **[Query All Files](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2106480)**
   - **Modify Metadata Through Metadata API Functions**
   - **View Setup And Configuration**

4. If **Salesforce CRM Content** is active in your organization:

   - Grant Salesforce CRM Content access to the Defender for Cloud Apps service admin account.
   - Turn off **Lock sessions to the IP address from which they originated** for the service account profile.
   - Turn on **Content Deliveries and Public Links**.

Note

To query file sharing data, enable the Content Deliveries feature for Defender for Cloud Apps. For more information, see [ContentDistribution](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_contentdistribution.htm).

### Configure Defender for Cloud Apps

Perform the following steps to connect Defender for Cloud Apps to Salesforce:

1. In the Defender for Cloud Apps console, select **Investigate** and then **Connected apps**.
2. In the **App connectors** page, select **+Connect an app** followed by **Salesforce**.

   [![Screenshot that shows how to add the Salesforce app connector in the Defender portal.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/media/connect-salesforce.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/media/connect-salesforce.png#lightbox)
3. In the next window, enter a name for the connection and select **Next**.
4. In **Follow the link**, select **Connect Salesforce**.
5. Selecting **Connect Salesforce** opens the Salesforce sign-in page. Enter your credentials to allow Defender for Cloud Apps access to your team's Salesforce app.

   [![Screenshot that shows a pop-up and how to enter your Salesforce credentials.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/media/salesforce-logon.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/media/salesforce-logon.png#lightbox)
6. Salesforce asks if you want to allow Defender for Cloud Apps access to your team information and activity log and to perform any activity as any team member. Select **Allow** to continue.
7. You receive a success or failure notice for the deployment. Defender for Cloud Apps is now authorized in Salesforce.com.
8. Back in the Defender for Cloud Apps console, you see the **Salesforce was successfully connected** message.
9. In the Microsoft Defender portal, select **Settings**. Then choose **Cloud Apps**. Under **Connected apps**, select **App Connectors**. Make sure the status of the connected App Connector is **Connected**.

After you connect Salesforce, Defender for Cloud Apps collects login events and Setup Audit Trail entries from the seven days before connection, and Event Monitoring data from the previous 30 days or one day, depending on your Salesforce Event Monitoring license.

Defender for Cloud Apps calls the Salesforce APIs directly. Because Salesforce limits the number of API calls per period, Defender for Cloud Apps reads the API counters returned in each Salesforce response and always keeps 10% of the available calls in reserve.

When you enable [Salesforce real-time event monitoring \(Preview\)](#enable-salesforce-real-time-event-monitoring-preview), detection latency for identity and OAuth attacks drops from hours to minutes. Detections also include more context, such as the connected app name and ID, app permissions, user agent, IP address, and session information.

Note

- Defender for Cloud Apps throttling is calculated solely on its own API calls with Salesforce, not with those of any other applications making API calls with Salesforce. Limiting API calls due to throttling might temporarily slow data ingestion in Defender for Cloud Apps, but the process typically catches up overnight.
- If your Salesforce instance isn't in English, select the appropriate **language** attribute value for the integration service admin account. To change the language attribute, go to **Administration** > **Users** > **User** and open the integration system admin account. Now go to **Locale Settings** > **Language** and select the desired language.

Defender for Cloud Apps processes Salesforce events on the following schedule:

- Sign-in events every 15 minutes
- Setup audit trails every 15 minutes
- Event logs every 1 hour. For more information about Salesforce events, see [Using event monitoring](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/using_resources_event_log_files.htm).

## Enable Salesforce real-time event monitoring \(Preview\)

To get the most detection coverage and the richest investigation context from the Salesforce connector, a Salesforce administrator must enable **Storing data** for a set of events in Salesforce Event Manager. Defender for Cloud Apps then ingests those events from Salesforce Real-Time Event Monitoring within minutes and uses them to improve detection coverage for OAuth abuse, session hijacking, credential stuffing, and anomalous API activity.

The Salesforce OAuth apps inventory also includes Connected Apps and External Client Apps \(ECAs\), along with each app's granted permissions and last used date. **Highly privileged** and **Unused** app insights for Salesforce help you identify OAuth apps that need review. For more information, see [Application inventory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/applications-inventory) and [View your app details with app governance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/app-governance-visibility-insights-view-apps).

Enable these events for the best detection coverage. Enabling these events gives you better latency and more robust detections.

### Enable the events in Salesforce Event Manager

Perform the following steps in Salesforce Event Manager to enable the required events:

1. Sign in to Salesforce as an administrator.
2. Go to `https://YOURDOMAIN.lightning.force.com/lightning/setup/EventManager/home`.
3. Search for each of the following events and enable **Storing data**:

   - API Anomaly Event
   - API Event
   - Credential Stuffing Event
   - Guest User Anomaly Event
   - Identity Provider Event
   - Identity Verification Event
   - Permission Set Event
   - Report Anomaly Event
   - Report Event
   - Session Hijacking Event
