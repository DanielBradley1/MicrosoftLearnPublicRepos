# Configuration protection in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Important

The features described in this article are currently in Preview, aren't available in all organizations, and are subject to change.

Configuration protection is a configuration enforcement model that makes cloud-managed policy the single source of truth for Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings. When configuration protection is enabled, Intune and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint policies take precedence. The device ignores settings from Group Policy, scripts, Microsoft Configuration Manager, and local admin changes.

Configuration protection eliminates configuration drift and policy conflicts by extending tamper-protection-style enforcement to the entire Defender Antivirus configuration surface.

[Tamper protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/tamper-protection-overview) and configuration protection are complementary but distinct capabilities:

| Feature | Tamper protection | Configuration protection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Small fixed set of security settings \(~10-13 settings\) | Entire Defender Antivirus configuration surface |
| **Configuration source** | Microsoft-defined defaults only | Organization-defined cloud policy \(Intune/Defender for Endpoint\) |
| **Customization** | No customization | Full policy-driven control |
| **Enforcement** | Prevents disabling critical protections | Overrides all non-cloud configuration channels |

Configuration protection is a superset of tamper protection that provides policy-driven control over the full Microsoft Defender Antivirus configuration.

Note

Although tamper protection and configuration protection can technically be turned on at the same time, we recommend that your organization selects one or the other.

## Prerequisites

- Devices must be onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- Devices must be managed through Microsoft Intune or Defender for Endpoint security settings management.
- Devices must run Windows 10, Windows 11, or Windows Server 2019.
- Devices must run Microsoft Defender for Endpoint EDR Sensor version later than 10.8804 \(September 2025\).
- Devices must run Microsoft Defender Antivirus platform version 4.18.26060.3004 or later \(June 2026\).

Configuration protection doesn't currently support:

- Co-management \(Configuration Manager + Intune\) environments.
- GCC High environments.

## What configuration protection covers

Currently, configuration protection provides protection and enforcement for Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings, including:

- Antivirus configuration \(scan settings, exclusions, updates\)
- Attack surface reduction \(ASR\) policies
- Defender Configuration Service Provider \(CSP\) and Policy CSP surface \(broad set of antivirus-related controls\)
- Local admin merge behavior

Currently, configuration protection doesn't cover:

- Microsoft Defender Device Control
- Endpoint detection and response \(EDR\) settings
- Windows operating system settings \(such as Firewall\)

## How configuration protection enforcement works

Configuration protection enforces cloud-managed policy through three mechanisms:

- **Single-source enforcement**: When configuration protection is enabled, the following enforcement rules apply:

  - Only Intune and Defender for Endpoint policies are honored for Defender Antivirus settings.
  - Group Policy Object \(GPO\), scripts, Configuration Manager, and local admin changes are ignored.
  - Microsoft Defender Antivirus doesn't honor local exclusions. Organizations can still choose to allow local administrator-defined exclusions by enabling the local administrator merge setting through policy. When local administrator merge is enabled, locally defined exclusions can be merged with centrally managed exclusions.

- **Secure defaults**: If a setting isn't explicitly configured in a policy, configuration protection applies Microsoft-defined defaults. This behavior ensures that devices maintain a strong security posture even when administrators haven't configured every available setting.
- **Conflict resolution**: Configuration protection uses a value-based precedence model rather than a last-write-wins model:

  - **On** takes precedence over **Off**. If one policy sets configuration protection to On and another sets it to Off, the feature stays enabled on the device.
  - If multiple policies assign different values, a conflict is reported, but the On value is still enforced.
  - If multiple policies assign the same value, the result is success with no conflict.


  Important


  **Not configured** doesn't mean **Off**. To disable the feature, explicitly deploy a policy that sets configuration protection to **Off**.

## Enable configuration protection

You can enable configuration protection through either Microsoft Intune or [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security settings management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/endpoint-security-policies-configure).

> Microsoft Intune is the recommended tool for configuring and distributing Defender for Endpoint features to devices. However, Intune is a separate product that isn't part of Defender for Endpoint, and it isn't included in all subscriptions. To use Intune, you need a subscription that includes it, or you can buy it separately as a standalone subscription or add-on. If you don't have Intune, you can use any of the other methods in this article. For more information, see [Microsoft Intune licensing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/fundamentals/licenses).

Configuration protection is configured through the same policy surface as tamper protection. In the Windows Security Experience profile, Intune renames the tamper protection setting to **Configuration protection \(Device\)** when configuration protection is available. You can't enable configuration protection through the Settings Catalog or the Device Control v1 \(DCv1\) template.

Because configuration protection and tamper protection use the same policy setting, setting **Configuration protection \(On\)** supersedes the tamper protection value on that device. You don't deploy separate tamper protection and configuration protection policies for the same setting. To migrate existing tamper protection \(DCv1\) policies to configuration protection, create a Windows Security Experience policy with **Configuration protection \(On\)**, then remove the tamper protection setting from your DCv1 policies to avoid conflicts.

1. On the **Endpoint security** page in the Microsoft Intune admin center at [https://intune.microsoft.com](https://intune.microsoft.com), create a new Windows Security Experience profile or edit an existing one.
2. Locate the **Configuration protection \(Device\)** setting \(formerly **Tamper Protection**\).
3. Set the value to **Configuration protection \(On\)** to enable configuration protection.
4. Assign the policy to the appropriate device groups.

## Minimum client version and rollback

Before you assign **Configuration protection \(On\)**, update devices to Microsoft Defender Antivirus platform version 4.18.26060.3004 or later, and validate the deployment with a pilot group.

On devices with earlier platform versions, Intune might send **Configuration protection \(On\)** and **Tamper Protection \(Off\)**, but the device might apply only the tamper protection setting. This behavior leaves both configuration protection and tamper protection turned off.

To roll back, change the Windows Security Experience policy from **Configuration protection \(On\)** to **Tamper Protection \(On\)**, redeploy the policy, sync the affected devices, and verify that tamper protection is enabled. Normal policy delivery latency applies.

## Reporting and monitoring

Configuration protection status is visible in both the Intune admin center and the Microsoft Defender portal, depending on how devices are managed.

- **Intune**: For devices enrolled directly through Intune by using Mobile Device Management \(MDM\), you can view:

  - Policy status \(Success, Conflict, or Error\)
  - Device-level configuration protection status

- **Microsoft Defender portal**: For devices managed through Defender for Endpoint security settings management, check the Microsoft Defender portal for effective configuration state.

  Note

  These devices aren't visible in Intune reports. Use the Microsoft Defender portal to verify the effective configuration protection state.

## Verify configuration protection on a device

To confirm the configuration protection state directly on a device, run the following PowerShell cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-MpComputerStatus
```

Review the following properties in the output:

- **ControlledConfigurationState**: The current configuration protection enforcement state on the device.
- **IsTamperProtected**: Indicates whether tamper protection \(the foundation of configuration protection\) is active.
- **TamperProtectionSource**: The source that enforces the current state.

You can also use `Get-MpComputerStatus` to confirm that the Microsoft Defender Antivirus platform version meets the [prerequisites](#prerequisites), and to validate the configuration state after a policy change or a configuration protection reset.

## Lifecycle behaviors

Configuration protection behavior varies depending on device lifecycle changes:

- **Policy unassignment**: Configuration protection is removed from the device unless another configuration protection policy still applies.
- **Defender for Endpoint unenrollment**: Configuration protection remains **On** \(not cleaned up automatically\).
- **Device offboarding**: Configuration protection is removed and reset to **Off**.

## Reset configuration protection on a device

To clear the configuration protection state on a device, run the following commands in an elevated Command Prompt \(a Command Prompt window you opened by selecting **Run as administrator**\):

Tip

The device must have tamper protection turned on and be in troubleshooting mode.

The first command changes the directory to the latest version of <antimalware platform version> in `%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\<antimalware platform version>`. If that path doesn't exist, it goes to `%ProgramFiles%\Windows Defender`.

```dos
(set "_done=" & if exist "%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\" (for /f "delims=" %d in ('dir "%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform" /ad /b /o:-n 2^>nul') do if not defined _done (cd /d "%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\%d" & set _done=1)) else (cd /d "%ProgramFiles%\Windows Defender")) >nul 2>&1

MpCmdRun.exe -Config -ResetControlledConfiguration
```

For more information, see [Enable and use troubleshooting mode in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/troubleshooting-mode-enable).

## Known limitations

Currently, the following limitations apply to configuration protection:

- You might see false conflicts in Intune when both tamper protection and configuration protection policies target the same device.
- You might see reporting inconsistencies between the Intune admin center and the Microsoft Defender portal.
- Coverage is limited to Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings \(device control, EDR, and firewall aren't yet covered\).
- When you turn on configuration protection through Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security settings management or Intune, tamper protection is turned off, unless another tamper protection policy explicitly sets tamper protection to on. When configuration protection is on and tamper protection is off, the tamper protection secure score is lower. We're working to address this gap.
